In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.     However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife.     Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said.     However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said.     World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year.     Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3," U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA     WASHINGTON, MARCH 20 - The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.     ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing,"" Myers said.     The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

7," LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT     CHICAGO, March 20 - The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said.     The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.     ""I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week,"" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said.     Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week.     ""We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,"" Levitt said.     Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said.     However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.     Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, ""I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less.""

8," STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING     By Jane Arraf, Reuters     MONTREAL, March 20, Reuter - The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said.     Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.     In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.     By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal.     The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.     The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.     The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.     ""It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,"" Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.     The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.     ""We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,"" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.     ""These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway,"" George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently.     The workers' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     ""We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won't see a major increase for a number of years,"" Hemsley said.     A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years, Blair said.

23," WALL STREET SURVIVES TRIPLE EXPIRATIONS     By Cal Mankowski, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 20 -  The four-times-a-year ""triple witching hour"" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has in the past.     Market averages finished sharply higher as stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks expired simultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may be retraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is getting used to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity in the final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchange said the day went smoothly and efficiently.     ""This has been one of the few times that the consensus has been right,"" said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch and Co.     He expects a ""follow-through"" Monday and Tuesday to the advance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 points for the day and 75 points for the entire week.     Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved in arbitrage activity involving index futures and options, said the general trend of the market has been upward for months. ""Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with more money,"" he said.     He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accounts prior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japanese investors are apparently helping push stocks higher.     Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc, said reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end of the fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.     He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedged with short positions in index futures rolled the expiring March futures over into June contracts. But he added different players with other goals also were active and there was no simple explanation of the market's gyrations.     For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the June Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15 minutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, the contracted dipped to 297.50. ""That could have been a wave of selling from institutional people making a roll,"" he said.     It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500 hit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. ""It looks like the market is going to continue to go higher,"" he said.     ""Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was a strong day for stocks,"" said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.     Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by ""good solid buying interest"" which will cushion any pullback.     Other investors who were long futures and short stocks bought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, said Mark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against ""over-dramatizing"" the day's activity, which said was more a reflection of fundamental strength in the markets.     Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was mostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options and individual options expired. He said there could be a decline early next week in the stock market.     ""It looked like it worked well today,"" said Howard Kramer, asssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and Exchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have to be analyzed next week.     He said there was relatively little commotion at the close, with about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minute compared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three months earlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points in the closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.     Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility, disclosure of ""market-on-close"" orders in 50 major stocks 30 minutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances of modest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening out volatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of the imbalance.     The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47 stocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, and no significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tightened a rule governing what type of market on close orders can be accepted in the final half hour.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

28," CANADA'S CLARK SEES TRADE AS MOST URGENT PROBLEM     By Dean Lokken, Reuters     SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 - Trade is the most urgent problem facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark, Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.     Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.     ""The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,"" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. ""We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.""     Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October.     He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.     On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.     In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.     ""This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,"" he said.     Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said.     ""There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,"" he said.     In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada.     Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.     ""What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,"" he said.     In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. ""Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,"" he said. REUTER  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

32," ALBERTA BUDGET SETS TAX INCREASE, LOWER DEFICIT     EDMONTON, Alberta, March 20 - The Alberta provincial government will increase its general corporate tax rate on April 1 to 15 pct from 11 pct under its 1987-88 budget announced today, provincial treasurer Dick Johnston said.     The budget forecasts the 1987-88 provincial deficit to be 1.90 billion dlrs, compared to a forecast deficit of 3.30 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, Johnston said.     The budget forecasts fiscal 1988 revenues of 8.63 billion dlrs and expenditures of 10.42 billion dlrs, Johnston said.     The provincial budget raises combined personal and corporate income taxes by about 20 pct, Johnston said.     Johnston told a news conference taxes were increased after revenues from oil and gas taxes fell by 64 pct last year and are not expected to increase sharply in the short term.     The provincial government expects resource tax revenues for fiscal 1987 to fall to 1.30 billion dlrs from a previously estimated 2.20 billion dlrs, compared to 3.60 billion dlrs collected in fiscal 1986 before the collapse in oil prices.     Johnston told reporters he needed to raise taxes in order to begin moving towards a balanced budget in 1990-91.     Johnston said the personal income tax increase takes three forms. The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from 43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.     The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pct surtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000 dlrs, he said.     In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax on all individuals with taxable income.     Johnston said overall government spending of 10.42 billion dlrs represents a cut of 4.4 pct, but various grants and tax credits for agriculture and energy industries will remain.

40," NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE     By NAILENE CHOU-WIEST, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 17 - Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements.     ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.     An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said.     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.     ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),"" he said.     In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted.     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales.     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year.     AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.     Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990.     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

43," U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS     By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters     WASHINGTON, March 20 - The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.     Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.     President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.     ""I am confident we will see action taken,"" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters.     ""I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,"" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.     The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries.     They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.     Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, ""The clear import of what he said is that there will be.""     ""Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,"" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.     The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems.     Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries.     But McClure said senators told him, ""There is no doubt dumping is going on,"" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products.     The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.     In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.     Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact.     Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.     The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine offices in Texas and Oklahoma, was closed after state regulators concluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.     The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, who bought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs in assets.     The bank board said growth was accomplished largely through the purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbo certificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total deposits at the end of 1986.     The bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfolio was nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.     It said Vernon also paid excessive salaries and dividends to officers and directors and bought a beach house and five airplances for the use of thrift executives and stockholders.     The bank board ousted the thrift's officers and directors and hired another Texas association to run it.     The bank board also said it closed First Federal of Maryland, a federal savings association that had 115.2 mln dlrs in assets. It said its 118 mln dlrs in insured deposits were transferred to Columbia First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Washington, D.C.

The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months.     Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.     Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful.     Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.     Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.     Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.     Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.     Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate.     Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations.     Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government  expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years.     The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984.     Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market --  10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer.     One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country.     But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years.     The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme.     Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow.     Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years.     The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports.     The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.

59," MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT     GENEVA, March 21 - The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls.     The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).     In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one.     The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (""may sell"") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (""may buy"") price (171 cts) for six months.     If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides.     The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement.     Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.     Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends.     As in the present accord the ""may buy"" and ""may sell"" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the ""must buy"" and ""must sell"" levels at 20 pct of it.     The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.     During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.     The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.     Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.     At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created.     Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked ""relatively well.""     Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the ""must buy"" level.     They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber.     In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. ""It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,"" one delegate said.     The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.     To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports.     Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.     The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The drought will affect both the summer harvest in the south and the spring sowing under way in the north.     It said the most seriously affected areas are Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanxi and Guangxi.     It said that, despite bigger snowfalls this year than last in Hebei and Shanxi and more rainfall forecast for some areas, the drought will not abate in the near future.     This is because the drought has lasted so long that slight increases in rainfall are not enough to alleviate it, the paper said.     It said that the water level on the middle reaches of the Yangtze has fallen to its lowest level in more than 110 years, so that more than 100 ports along it cannot receive ships.     Water level of other major rivers, including the Zhujiang, Qiantangjiang and Minjiang, have also been affected by the drought, the paper added but gave no more details.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year.     The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.     A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation equipment, and less mining and house construction.     The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar, which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.     He expected the decline to continue in the next few months because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.     The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to the U.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to the dollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economists said.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.     Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.

68," WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA     By Jeremy Clift, Reuters     JAKARTA, March 22 - World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.     Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.     He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments.     Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half.     Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.     Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit.     Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy.     ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said in his arrival statement.     But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.     ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport.     Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.     Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold.     But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.     Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.

69," GERMAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING TWO PCT IN 1987     FRANKFURT, March 22 - Bundesbank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger said that although West German economic growth was not expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, two pct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.     A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen export prospects and have a negative effect on investments, he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if such an appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.     The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2 pct or more in its annual economic report published in January, but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.     Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to rise strongly. Government expenditure and construction were also expected to increase. But there was uncertainty about the prospects for exports and investment.     The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply overshoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an effect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, there were potential dangers in the long run.     Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the West German money supply would grow within the three to six pct target zone set in December.     Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the drop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for some time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise between one and two pct this year.     He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for the West German economy. Although there was a possibility of a downturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this would happen in 1988.     The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from its close ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, also told the Futures Industry Association that he did not think congressional tax writers would approve a tax on stock transfers or ease taxes to promote U.S. Exports.     He congratulated House Speaker James Wright for proposing tax increases to help cut the budget deficit.     Rostenkowski said he hoped White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker could persuade President Reagan to support a package of tax increases and spending cuts.     He noted that Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker both supported tax increases in l982.     Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of new taxes might have to be found, along with nine billion in defence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domestic spending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would be brought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders felt there was Republican support.     A string of indictments of Wall Street figures could move some in Congress to support a tax on stock transfers, he said.     ""But the fact many people don't like what's happening in financial markets doesn't mean they will be hit with a tax,"" he said, noting that Wright's securities tax idea had not been ""fleshed out.""     Efforts by special interests to rewrite provisions of the tax reform bill will fall on deaf ears, Rostenkowski predicted.

73," NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA     By Nick Kotch, Reuters     LAGOS, March 22 - Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily.     The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction.     This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower ""marginal"" rate, analysts said.     ""It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,"" a Western diplomat commented.     The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26.     At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.     ""They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,"" the diplomat said.     The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.     It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction.     Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira.     If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said.     Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid.     SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa.     The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy.     The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards.     Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.     ""So far so good"" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.     Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said.     Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September.

74," ECONOMIST CALLS BRAZIL DEBT REQUEST MODEST     SAN FRANCISCO, March 22 - Brazil's attempt to seek better terms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is responsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers said.     ""I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its debt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a responsible request on their part,"" economist Martin Feldstein said at a news conference.     ""It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but rather modest additional amounts.""     Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business and government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.     Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third World debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additional credit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and international agencies.     ""Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remain constant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in Brazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in the real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,"" he said.     Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt problems were less serious than those faced by the international monetary system in 1983 and 1985.     However, the European representative on the task force, Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank PLC, disagreed.     He called the present situation more difficult and, in a draft proposal included in the task force's report, suggested setting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with a fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.     Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report.     One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth.     Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed.     He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money.     The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to promote closer cooperation among the three regions.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
75," SARNEY MEETS BRAZIL BUSINESS LEADERS     By Stephen Powell, Reuters     SAO PAULO, March 22 - President Jose Sarney, whose handling of the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held private talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that government policies are leading to recession.     Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo owned by millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline, Sarney met more than 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil's economic crisis.     Business leaders said before the meeting they would be pressing for less government interference in what they describe as a tightly regulated economy.     Their concerns include the country's high rates of interest and tough restrictions on imports.     Machline, president of the Sharp electronics group and a personal friend of Sarney's, told television reporters outside his farm that he wanted ""less government participation in the economy.""     When the government announced a month ago that it was suspending interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growth and avoiding recession.     But business leaders and economic analysts say there are growing signs that Brazil's economy, the eighth biggest in the non-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pct growth last year.     Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on industry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year because of the country's deteriorating trade balance.     Cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally owned Banco do Brasil, has told companies they must limit their imports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.     Business sources say that in practice importing even this amount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on a case-by-case basis.     The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in many sectors of the economy there was a real fear that production lines would grind to a halt next month.     One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato, head of the powerful Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation (FIESP).     Business sources said he would argue that unless there were a relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial activity was inevitable.     Relations between Sarney and the business community have at times been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed up the importance of the meeting.     In one bizarre dispute in January, Sarney surprised Brazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies of the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburst came after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying government regulations on price controls.     Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government's economic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.

76," U.S., LATIN NATIONS DELAY DECISION ON IADB     By Peter Torday, Reuters     MIAMI, March 22 - The United States and major Latin American nations agreed to set aside sharp differences over control of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and reconsider the issue this summer.     The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting here ahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off any decisions when it became apparent differences between Washington and the Latin countries ware too great.     IABD officials said Washington had indicated, however, it might be prepared to compromise in the future.     The United States is the principal donor nation and has pressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowing nations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.     The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part of its controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.     The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks like the IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations which would promote open markets, reduced government intervention and inflation-free economic growth.     Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium last month, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy and officials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepen rifts between the United States and Third World nations.     IADB officials also said Washington hinted at future compromise. ""The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach an agreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could be reached,"" said an official who asked not to be named.     Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr, four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issue is not resolved.     But it has asked Congress to give it authority to finance its one-third share in the event agreement on voting power is reached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and wants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.     Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove loans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings and resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's taste.     The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is expected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a speech to the bank's annual meeting on Monday.     But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United States has some room for compromise and also to fend off other challenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to innovative solutions to the debt problem.

The announcement, in a Bank of Italy statement, followed the decision on Friday by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria to send in special commissioners after accepting the resignation of Carical president Francesco Sapio and hearing a report detailing ""serious irregularities"" at the bank.     Goria's decision was taken in line with a provision in Italy's banking legislation which allows the Treasury to dissolve administrative bodies in the case of ""serious management irregularities or serious violations of legal and statutory norms"" that regulate credit institutions.     Senior officials declined to give details of the irregularities that had come to light at Carical, whose activities are concentrated in Calabria in the toe of Italy.

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,"" he said.     ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,"" Moore said.     He added: ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000.""     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last Sepember. The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in June.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government.     The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report.     The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos.     The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares.     Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.     The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week.     ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.     ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised.""     San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines.

British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restore diplomatic relations with Syria, broken off by London last October after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showed Syrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner.     But one official said the king would be told Britain still needs ""clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians have renounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't.""     Britain will stress its support for an international peace conference on the Middle East and its concern over alleged human rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, the officials told Reuters.     The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip during the visit, his first to Britain since he assumed power in June 1982.     King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade, defence, oil and health ministers, who will hold talks with their British counterparts.     Relations between the two countries have generally been warm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35 British nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and the publication of a letter by a retired British ambassador describing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant.     Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in the Middle East.     Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year while British imports from that country in the same period totalled 436 mln.     Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain can offer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever arms export order.     Under the five billion stg deal signed last year, Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy 132 warplanes including 72 Tornado fighters.     Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer is likely to discuss oil price stabilisation but Britain would not change its refusal to limit its North Sea oil production and exports, officials said.     Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has asked all oil-producing countries to help stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel by curbing output and exports.

95," RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL     AMMAN, March 22 - The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country.     Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986.     Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.     Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said.     Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.     Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.     The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.  REUTER ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar.""     He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries.     ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said.     ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said.     While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said.     ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview.     Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.

97," U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING     By Claire Miller, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 23 - A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said.     ""Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,"" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week.     The ""mini-refunding,"" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.     The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.     Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities.     But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit.     ""Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,"" they said in a weekly report.     Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales.     ""The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,"" he said in a weekly market review.     But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run.     ""Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,"" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc.     Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1.     And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.     Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.     Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said.     This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct.     Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined.     Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.     Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday.     Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
98," SWISS BANKERS PLANNING COMPROMISE ON SECRECY CURBS     By Peter Conradi, Reuters     ZURICH, March 23 - Bankers, concerned about official calls for curbs on Switzerland's banking secrecy, are likely to propose a compromise plan when they meet regulators today, the Bankers Federation Secretary said.     Andreas Hubschmid confirmed a report in yesterday's Sonntagsblick the Federation would make proposals to curb the anonymity given to some bank clients who hide their identities behind lawyers or fiduciary agents.     ""The Sonntagsblick story goes in the right direction, and I cannot deny it,"" Hubschmid told Reuters.     Hubschmid declined to confirm details, saying nothing had yet been decided.     Recent allegations U.S. Officials involved in the arms-for-Iran scandal took advantage of Swiss discretion to open accounts here have added fuel to the long-running secrecy debate, while Manila has said former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos put a fortune into banks here.     While Swiss banks are strictly forbidden to reveal the names of their clients to the outside world, a self-governing code of conduct dating from 1977 requires the bankers themselves know the identities of their clients.     But the banking code, due for renewal this October, allows a client to hide his name behind a lawyer provided the latter signs the so-called ""B-form"" guaranteeing that his client is not misusing his anonymity for criminal purposes.     The Commission said at the end of last year it wanted use of the form drastically reduced.     The bankers' compromise plan, Sonntagsblick said, quoting reliable sources, aims to eliminate abuses by differentiating between lawyers who just manage portfolios for their clients and those who do so only as a small part of a wider legal service.     Only in the second case, would the use of the B-form still be allowed, it said. Other clients would have to give up their anonymity and reveal their identities to the bank.     Commission President Hermann Bodenmann said the Commission was likely to discuss the proposal at today's meeting with the bankers, and during its own council session on Tuesday. He declined further comment.  The banks draw up their own rules of conduct. But banking analysts said the banks cannot afford to ignore the views of the Commission, which is ultimately responsible for preventing abuses.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs. It said it already holds 1.91 mln of TMOC's 25 cent par shares.     TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin, the company said in a statement.     Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production, exploration and pipeline interests.     In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of <N.T.

100," DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER     FRANKFURT, March 23 - The solution of the world's debt crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.     Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's suspension last month of part of its interest payments would lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.     It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said.     Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country.     Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices.     Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and creditor banks.     ""This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks alone,"" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the international banking system would provide more funds, but the problem is not just economic but also political.

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. ""That's a very healthy development,"" he added.""If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.""     ""Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,"" Yeutter said.     ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.""

Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.     He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so, but he said creditors and international institutions should show more ""understanding"" for Yugoslavia's situation.     Mikulic said Yugoslavia had ""understanding"" for what Brazil had done.     Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.     Government ministers told reporters last week they regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the cost to the economy had been too great.     Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, ""radical changes"" in interest rates and repayment times were needed.     Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments.     Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the Paris club at the end of this month.     The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year.

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.""      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.

The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt, the biggest in the Third World.     Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth.     Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found little favour among the country's business community.     Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.     ""We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, if necessary going to the IMF,"" Mario Amato, president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.      An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing.     The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present at yesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his absence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present seized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see Funaro leave his job.

It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.     The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.     The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.     It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year.     But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external debt remains worrying and should be controlled.

After expecting improvements in two previous quarterly surveys, 56 pct of respondents reported working at less than satisfactory levels, with insufficient orders nominated by 70 pct as the major constraint.     Other constraints were capacity, 11 pct, and labour nine pct, the survey said.     Inflationary pressure increased during the quarter and investment plans for the next year were scaled down, which the survey said could limit activity in the medium to short term.     Respondents reporting an increase in orders fell to 22 pct in March from 30 pct in December, while those with orders accepted but not yet delivered fell to 14 pct from 21 pct.     Stocks of finished goods and raw materials fell sharply in the March quarter and further depletion was forecast for the June quarter, the survey said.     Respondents said finance was harder to obtain, which Westpac chief economist Bob Graham said was probably because of high interest rates rather than the availability of money.     Graham said he thought expectations would gradually improve later this year, when the dollar might consolidate and interest rates ease slightly.     He believed some manufacturers were not investing because they feared the Australian dollar would get stronger.

Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer.     Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer.     It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval.     The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said.     Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.     Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement.     It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package.     It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.     Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition.     Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee.     Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan.     Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy.     Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.     Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres.     Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.     The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty.     Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.

116," AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES     SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 23 - The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.     Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.     This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.     Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said.     Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said.     Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.     By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.     Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.     Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said.     At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.     Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.     For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.     He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
117," BAKER WARNS AGAINST FORGIVENESS OF LATIN DEBT     MIAMI, March 22 - U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said any attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin American debtor nations might damage the world economy.     In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald, Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief, calling it a ""dramatic, overnight solution.""     ""While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run,"" he said.     The article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).     Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third World debt.     Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the U.S. Strategy.     Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.     ""Together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors in 1987,"" Baker wrote.     He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries. ""These swaps aren't a panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden,"" he said.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and oil-related items.     But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be repeated this year because of projected higher prices for primary commodities and oil.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

120," BRAZIL SEEKS TO REASSURE BANKS ON DEBT SUSPENSION     MIAMI, March 23 - Brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor Francisco Gros said.     Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of Brazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.     But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was inconclusive.     The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     ""It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very far at the first meeting,"" one banker said.     The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank.     The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the end of March.     Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.     Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15. Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis. Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, ""It could happen.""     Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with Brazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     ""If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't meet all its obligations,"" he said.     Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     But he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     ""It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons,"" he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.     Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the banks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed by the country's creditors.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

127," IADB DISPUTE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN DEBT CONFLICTS     By Keith Grant, Reuters     MIAMI, March 23 - Controversy surrounding U.S.-backed reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) underscores the mounting challenge to Washington's current debt strategy, according to Latin American officials and delegates to the IADB meeting that begins here today.     The bank's policy-making board on Saturday postponed a decision on the reforms until June in view of strong Latin American opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its control over lending to the region.     Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategy through increased lending, but as the bank's largest single shareholder it also wants to require countries to adopt far-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.     The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year's meeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in an institution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of as their own.     ""It's almost an issue of sovereignty for the Latin Americans,"" one IADB official said.     With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nations have had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in project loans since the bank's founding in 1959.     The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by a Mexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly critical of U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.     Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to the region if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a news conference last week he warned that Latin defaults were a distinct possibility in the long run.     Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no way interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the issue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time, officials and delegates said.     They said creditors are not ready to discuss debt forgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity swaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic reforms.     Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions on lending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations for the bank if it does not get its way.     Latin America, while retaining reservations, now accepts the principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is unwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powers on lending, officials and delegates said.     Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35 pct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans are unwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. To line up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.     This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, and particularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADB unless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable resentment among Latin Americans.     ""Debtors have already shown considerable willingness to sacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is not at issue,"" one Latin American official said.     The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of IADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as against 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.     It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said.     McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.     Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.     He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.     More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said.     McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability.     ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,"" he said.

The officials said the move could lead to the collapse of the opposition coalition between the Liberal and National parties, which has been under severe strain in recent weeks.     In a television interview yesterday prime minister Bob Hawke said he might call an early election if strife within the opposition undermined business confidence and hurt Australia's economic recovery.     ""The opposition have not only destabilised themselves, they have prostituted the political and economic debate by putting up economic nostrums and stupidities that are destabilizing business confidence,"" Hawke said.     Howard relegated Peacock to the back benches after the Melbourne Sun published an alleged telephone conversation between Peacock and another opposition member in which Peacock was critical of Howard's leadership. The paper said the call was recorded by an unidentified man using an electronic radio scanner. In a statement Howard said the conversation was damaging to the party and implied disloyalty to him.     Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to ""hire and fire."" He refused to answer questions about any leadership challenge.     Liberal party officials said the move against Peacock could encourage his supporters to mount a challenge to Howard's leadership. Peacock was ousted as opposition leader by Howard in September 1985, after losing the 1984 general election to Hawke.

A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.

Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo.     ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said.     ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries.""     Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.     Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.     ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said.

He told Reuters in an interview that incoming orders in West Germany, VW's largest single market, had been very good in early 1987. Its share of the domestic car market rose to 29 pct in January and February from 26 pct in the year-ago period.     Hahn declined to forecast first quarter 1987 results, or answer questions about the VW currency scandal.     Hahn said he did not want to elaborate on statements VW had already issued on the affair and noted the case was now in the hands of state prosecutors.     VW, like other car manufacturers, had encountered difficult market conditions in the United States in early 1987, Hahn said, without giving details.     He declined to predict U.S. Sales for 1987 as a whole, saying it was particularly difficult this year to forecast sales trends in North America, VW's second largest regional market after Western Europe.     Hahn declined to comment directly on reports that 1986 losses at Spanish subsidiary Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo (SEAT) totalled up to 27 billion pesetas or that these losses were twice as high as expected.     But he said SEAT was developing according to plan and added the introduction of international accounting standards and changes to VW's own had led to some corrections to SEAT's figures.     VW hoped SEAT would reach break-even point in the course of this year. In 1986 SEAT's volume sales had been better than expected, Hahn said.     In January and February, 1987, SEAT's turnover in Europe rose 40 pct compared with the same months of 1986, Hahn said. Its European market share rose to 1.9 pct in January and February from 1.6 pct a year earlier.     Hahn said VW hoped to sign a contract with Ford Motor Co <F.N> in the summer on the planned joint venture between the two companies' loss-making operations in Argentina and Brazil.     A provisional joint management team was already looking at ways of synchronising the two operations, he said. VW's operations in Mexico had made again made a profit in 1986, he added.     Hahn, speaking to Reuters in an interview to mark production of VW's 50 millionth car, said VW had no plans to make acquisitions outside the automotive sector.     It also did not expect to raise capital again in the foreseeable future after increasing capital by 25 pct in 1986 in the biggest rights issue in West German history, Hahn said.     In a separate interview Karl-Heinz Briam, the management board member responsible for labour relations, said VW did not currently plan to increase its workforce further this year.     All of VW's domestic plants and most of its foreign production facilities were currently operating at full capacity, Briam said. The exceptions were VW's Nigerian operations and its Westmoreland plant in Pennsylvania.     Hahn said VW had recently taken steps to increase the flexibility and improve the structure of the Westmoreland plant. However, VW was not planning to increase production there at the moment.     ""Most of the VW vehicles (sold in the U.S.) will, as before, be built in Germany,"" Hahn said.     Hahn said there was room for further growth in West Germany, and predicted that 1987 would be a good year generally for the industry domestically.     Wolfgang Lincke, head of car development at VW, said the increasing environmental awareness of West German consumers would allow VW to sell more ""higher value"" cars in future containing equipment such as catalytic converters, which cut exhaust emissions.     Lincke declined to be drawn on when VW may introduce a successor to its current Golf model, which in 1983 replaced the original dating from 1974.     VW would in any case retain the Golf name. Of the 50 mln VW cars built since VW started commercial production after World War II, nearly nine mln have been Golfs, Lincke said.     VW, which traditionally releases its annual results in April or May, said last week 1986 profit and dividend would both be unchanged despite the need to make provision to cover the possible loss of 480 mln marks from allegedly fraudulent hedging operations.     VW has also said the currency scandal would not affect the company's investment spending.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
136," GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM      By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters     FRANKFURT, March 23 - West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.     But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.     The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said.     Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. ""The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,"" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study.     It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.     West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar.     West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.     ""It's not a taboo,"" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said.     But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.     The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.  Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.     It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.     But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing.     This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.     Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.     Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November.     Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said.     Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.     The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.     West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.     Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes.     But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.     The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits.     The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.     The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

""Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to decay, perhaps within the next 10 years,"" Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).     The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.     Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in the tax reform package, and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.     In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands.     A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next January, into consideration when they vote.     Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax ""The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).""     The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures.     A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified, said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party affiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.

140," JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND     TAUPO, New Zealand, March 23 - Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy.     Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved.     Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting, said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy, but did not elaborate.     Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits, payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.     Despite great potential, developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.     The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.     ""It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled,"" Hata said.     Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others.     In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end.     As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries, he said.

But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.     The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.     He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.     The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said.     This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.     Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.

Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where ""pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed.""     ""We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000,"" he said. ""We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain.""     The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.  REUTER ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended February 1.     Results for the first month of the new year were encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement.     The Big W discount store division and New South Wales supermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added.     Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27 mln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83 billion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against 105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but total sales were below target, Woolworths said.     The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit for the year to cover mark-downs on stock.     Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the sale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for reorganising the Big W chain.     Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W.

For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.     The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said.     Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark.     Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said.     If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector.     Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase.     Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.  REUTER ",0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.     Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos.

The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986.     The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year.     In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.     Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added.     Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.     Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and last year's 2.9 pct.

The Inspectorate statement said: ""Payments have been stopped out of regard for the depositors.""

""Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,"" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.     Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention.     At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.     Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so.     Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date.     The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.     Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.     The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.     Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.     ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said.

Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's suspension last month of part of its interest payments would lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.     It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said.     Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country.     Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices.     Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and creditor banks.     ""This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks alone,"" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the international banking system would provide more funds, but the problem is not just economic but also political.

It said its February survey showed firms were also increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the coming months, causing them to cut back production plans.     IFO blamed the worsening of the business climate and outlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreign demand.     More than a quarter of the firms polled said they thought orders in hand were insufficient.     Overall, the business climate in February could be described as just short of satisfactory, IFO said.     In a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, the institute said manufacturers of basic products judged the business climate to be slightly less favourable in February than in January. For the coming months they expect export prospects to dim and production to fall, it added.     Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand but they increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.     The business climate in the capital goods industry was unchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said this was due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercial vehicles.     Demand in the capital goods sector was generally described as weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had been in January, the institute said.     The business climate in the consumer durables sector remained above the industry average in February. Carmakers were again positive about current business but forecast a slight worsening of business conditions in the near future.     In the consumer goods industry business conditions were described as favourable in February.

European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. ""That's a very healthy development,"" he added.""If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.""     ""Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,"" Yeutter said.     ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.""     He added, ""Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.""  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0
186," PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS     By Peter Humphrey, Reuters     BELGRADE, March 23 - Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.     Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.     He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so, but he said creditors and international institutions should show more ""understanding"" for Yugoslavia's situation.     Mikulic said Yugoslavia had ""understanding"" for what Brazil had done.     Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.     Government ministers told reporters last week they regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the cost to the economy had been too great.     Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, ""radical changes"" in interest rates and repayment times were needed.     Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments.     Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the Paris club at the end of this month.     The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year.     Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.""      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""     He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.""     ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said.     Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual.     A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.     The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar.""     He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries.     ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said.     ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said.     While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said.     ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview.     Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.

The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt, the biggest in the Third World.     Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth.     Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found little favour among the country's business community.     Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.     ""We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, if necessary going to the IMF,"" Mario Amato, president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.      An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing.     The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present at yesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his absence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present seized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see Funaro leave his job.

194," BAKER WARNS AGAINST FORGIVENESS OF LATIN DEBT     MIAMI, March 23 - U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said any attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin American debtor nations might damage the world economy.     In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald, Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief, calling it a ""dramatic, overnight solution.""     ""While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run,"" he said.     The article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).     Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third World debt.     Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the U.S. Strategy.     Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.     ""Together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors in 1987,"" Baker wrote.     He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries. ""These swaps aren't a panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden,"" he said.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
195," BRAZIL SEEKS TO REASSURE BANKS ON DEBT SUSPENSION     MIAMI, March 23 - Brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor Francisco Gros said.     Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of Brazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.     But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was inconclusive.     The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     ""It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very far at the first meeting,"" one banker said.     The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank.     The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the end of March.     Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.     Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15. Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis. Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, ""It could happen.""     Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with Brazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     ""If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't meet all its obligations,"" he said.     Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     But he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     ""It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons,"" he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.     Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the banks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed by the country's creditors.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,"" he said.     ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,"" Moore said.    ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,"" he added.     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the ""Uruguay round"" talks last September. The talks are  also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.""     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.""     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

199," CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD     KAMPALA, March 23 - Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.     The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.     The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda's total exports.     The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.     These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said     Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports.     Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks.     However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements.     Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.     Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.     These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said.     According to the sources, the board's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts.     The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said.     The sources said the CMB's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.     ""The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,"" one of the sources said.     The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.

200," U.S. ECONOMIST CALLS BRAZIL DEBT REQUEST MODEST     SAN FRANCISCO, March 23 - Brazil's attempt to seek better terms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is responsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers said.     ""I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its debt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a responsible request on their part,"" economist Martin Feldstein said at a weekend news conference.     ""It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but rather modest additional amounts.""     Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business and government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.     Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third World debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additional credit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and international agencies.     ""Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remain constant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in Brazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in the real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,"" he said.     Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt problems were less serious than those faced by the international monetary system in 1983 and 1985.     However, the European representative on the task force, Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank PLC, disagreed.     He called the present situation more difficult and, in a draft proposal included in the task force's report, suggested setting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with a fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.     Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report.     One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth.     Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed.     He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money.     The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to promote closer cooperation among the three regions.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
201," U.S., LATIN NATIONS DELAY DECISION ON IADB     By Peter Torday, Reuters     MIAMI, March 23 - The United States and major Latin American nations agreed to set aside sharp differences over control of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and reconsider the issue this summer.     The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting here ahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off any decisions when it became apparent differences between Washington and the Latin countries ware too great.     IADB officials said Washington had indicated, however, it might be prepared to compromise in the future.     The United States is the principal donor nation and has pressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowing nations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.     The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part of its controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.     The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks like the IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations which would promote open markets, reduced government intervention and inflation-free economic growth.     Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium last month, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy and officials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepen rifts between the United States and Third World nations.     IADB officials also said Washington hinted at future compromise. ""The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach an agreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could be reached,"" said an official who asked not to be named.     Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr, four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issue is not resolved.     But it has asked Congress to give it authority to finance its one-third share in the event agreement on voting power is reached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and wants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.     Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove loans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings and resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's taste.     The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is expected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a speech to the bank's annual meeting today (Monday).     But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United States has some room for compromise and also to fend off other challenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to innovative solutions to the debt problem.

202," BAKER EXPECTED TO DEFEND DEBT STRATEGY      By Peter Torday, Reuters      MIAMI, March 23 - Treasury Secretary James Baker, facing the toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far, is expected today to stoutly defend the strategy.      At an opening address to the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once again to bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt relief.      The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrest control of IADB lending from Latin nations.      The Treasury Secretary is also expected, U.S. officials say, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan to promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and a much-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.      ""We have already seen substantial progress,"" Baker said in a Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant to be a ""quick fix"".      But Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia have all ceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil's interest payments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as a major challenge to the Baker plan.      Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, Brazil called an indefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt.      Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers last night to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months of extremely tough negotiations.      The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382 billion dlrs of foreign debt, Latin nations have since the start of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest and principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.      In addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight is estimated to have left the region during that time.      The Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, calls on commercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about 29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major debtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.      The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its economy, it can service its debt comfortably and without an atmosphere of crisis.      U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been paid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over 70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future  and Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep debtor-creditor negotiations afloat.      Baker is expected to underscore these points in his address today.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Previously it had sought all shares.     In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer and withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire April 3, along with the new proration period.     On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved USAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to acquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to sell the excess within one week.     USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1 pct on a fully diluted basis.     The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394 Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's application to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.

209," WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE     By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 23 - The world's dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.     ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,"" McIvor said.     Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.     McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.     ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said.     ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added.     McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.""     McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.     ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said.     McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline.     But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa.     McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.     ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,"" McIvor said.     McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.     Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.""     McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.     ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,"" McIvor said.     ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,"" he added.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The talks follow an agreement reached between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September, 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Its major trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion dlrs.     If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed by Finance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank Governor Abdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French export credit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said.     An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resume insurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in 1983.     The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of the demands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's estimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which agreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and a steering committee representing the commercial banks.     The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised because of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate in the agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by senior Nigerian officials and representatives of the steering committee.     The entire package also is being held up because of the need to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term insured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful that an accord will be struck by May 31.     The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors' claims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of letters of credit contained in the commercial bank rescheduling.     Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resume cover fairly soon as this could encourage other official creditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.     Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt reschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official export credit agencies.     British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down from 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, which do not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively.

Valerio earlier told reporters that the tiny territory would be returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, but gave no further details.

Asked if the issue of nationality after the Chinese takeover had been a problem in the talks, Valerio replied: ""It was one of them.""     China traditionally opposes granting dual nationality to its citizens and requires holders of foreign passports to give up their Chinese citizenship.

251," JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT     By Rich Miller, Reuters     TOKYO, March 23 - Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further.     ""We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,"" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.     ""If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.""     The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors.     Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action.     In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.     Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year.     He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market.     ""We have almost no grey market,"" he said. ""Supply is diminishing.""     To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc>.     Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.     The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong.     Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.     ""If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,"" he said.     The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.     He also called the case ""strange,"" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.     Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg"" (small) rains which fall at this time of year.     The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed.     Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains.     The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to take over American Motors.     American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award, made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60 mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged the award.     The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV> in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General last year sought protection under Chapter 11.     The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the development of certain components in the contract.     The components were for the military's ""High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle"" (HMMWV), American Motors said.     In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the Emerson Electric claims.     AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court, and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

270," IADB PLANS TO MATCH 1986 LENDING LEVEL     WASHINGTON, March 23 - The Inter-American Development Bank said it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrs it lent to Latin America in 1986, despite growing pressures on its capital.     In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead. The report said Latin America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     The report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization previously underused production capacity.     ""This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made,"" the report said.     The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.     To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed 1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its total outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.     In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio Ortiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank ""will be at a similar level to last year.""     He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed particularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and environmental and public health, education and urban development. The annual report was released as the Bank's annual meeting is being held in Miami.     Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries will discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan veto power from the current majority to 35 pct.     Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan it did not like with the assistance of only one other country.     The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new financing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the Latin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration to control the agency's critical loans.     The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power although it believes the bank's largest contributors should have greater influence within the institution.      Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
271," U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - NOVEL GMAC FINANCING     By John Picinich, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 23 - Because its novel financing deal sold quickly last week, General Motors Corp's <GM> General Motors Acceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings, said Michael Mangan of GMAC.     ""We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to do more,"" said Mangan, director of corporate financing.     Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price levels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small regional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc and PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.     ""We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,"" Mangan said.     ""GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their thoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the securities were placed,"" the GMAC officer added.     Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different pricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at attractive rates. ""GMAC saved some basis points with this technique,"" said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.     ""Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made sense, obviously we would not have done it,"" Mangan noted.     The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.     For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes, the offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.     Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield of 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases of more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20 to yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.     In contrast, Ford Motor Co's <F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit last month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to yield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.     ""Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,"" said an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk. ""They have to buy the securities in the secondary market.""     Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in the secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge number of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.     ""Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their holdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them,"" said one trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors would gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries if they could buy debt issues at or below par.     ""The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail investors,"" commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.     GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities that were aimed at the retail sector.     ""Access to retail investors was the driving force behind the multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to speak,"" Mangan said.     ""There is a lot of GMAC paper out there,"" the executive added, referring to the unit's past offerings. ""One of our basic strategies is to target securities to specific investors and hopefully attain a broader distribution.""     Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were selling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out by Friday afternoon.     ""In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions, you have to make a lot more telephone calls,"" an investment banker pointed out.     Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with co-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong retail bases. ""They can carve out a niche here,"" one said.     ""We plan to underwrite more of these deals,"" said a Korth official. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.     Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm underwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for Citicorp <CCI>.     GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth in October 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different price levels.     ""But the price gap between the first and second tier was large,"" Mangan said.

David Pryor, D-Ark., said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee's trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans, corn and wheat.     Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.     The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.

In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead.     The report said that Latin America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     The report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization of previously underused production capacity.     ""This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made,"" the report said.     The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The revisions take account of several factors including adjustments to unfilled orders levels, recalculation of new orders estimates and updating of seasonal adjustment factors, the department said.     As a result, December factory orders reported as rising 1.6 pct rose on the revised basis by 3.2 pct, while November orders reported as 3.6 pct were up only 0.8 pct on the revised basis, the department said.     Commerce has already reported January factory orders fell 4.0 pct. The report on February orders is due next week and that figure will be revised then.     The revisions, which cover the years 1982-1986, also affect the key category of durable goods orders. The department said durables orders reported as 1.5 pct higher in December were up 5.3 pct on the revised basis and November orders reported 5.1 pct higher were up a revised 3.0 pct.

""Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to decay, perhaps within the next 10 years,"" Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).     The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.     Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in the tax reform package, and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.     In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands.     A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next January, into consideration when they vote.     Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax ""The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).""     The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures.

309," BAKER SAYS U.S. MAKING PROGRESS REFORMING IADB     MIAMI, March 23 - U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said he was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American Development Bank with other member nations.     In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of the IADB, Baker said, ""We are making progress in negotiating reforms.""     And he added that if succesful, Washington would be ready to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB four-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.     It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the capital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such a capital increase.     But Baker's statement that he had made progress in negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was put off until next June because of deep differences between Washington and Latin borrowing countries.     Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of the bank's useable financial resources.     Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in IADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American countries.     But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote and frequently approve loans to which economic reform conditions are not tied.     Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct of the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the vote.     Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions for itself and other creditor countries.     ""In view of this imbalance we don't believe it is unreasonable to ask for a change,"" Baker said. He said the changes sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a greater majority of shares than a simple majority.     But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S. position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.     Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker said he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S. debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth, open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of debtor nations.     Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms in those areas of their economies.     Such reforms would include, among other things, more concern for natural resource management.     Baker said this lending should help debtors make a transition to more open economies and freer markets.     He also said the bank could double its current lending volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the poorest nations.     The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve its analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations. He urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker said, ""We simply believe that more discretion and policy influence should lie with the parties which contribute the lion's share of resources.""     He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the Reagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB and other multilateral development banks.     Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the best of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if Congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down slightly from a year ago, it said.     Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and time large shipments for the second half, it said.     Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing last year's, bookings are ""very good"" for orders on several of its new product introductions for 1987.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.     Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.     Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.     Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.     Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.     The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks.     The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.     It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.     The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45.     Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

314," BAKER URGES BANKS TO MULL NEW LOAN PLANS     MIAMI, March 23 - Treasury Secretary James Baker urged commercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third world debt burden.     ""I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative ideas for reducing the debt burden,"" Baker told the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.     But he said that he was confident banks would make ""substantial new lending"" to the major debtors this year.     He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to grow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate of growth since 1980.     Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making ""substantial headway"", Baker said import volumes of debtor countries are forecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost five pct -- the best performance in three years.     He also said economic growth has kept pace with or surpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors since 1983.     ""This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one,"" the Treasury Secretary said, and he urged the audience of Western and Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against suggestions of solutions like debt relief.     While such ideas have political appeal, Baker said, they would mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.     And even if free market reforms followed, debt fogiveness would frighten away investors who would not ""risk their capital in a country which abandoned its obligations.""     And he said, ""A debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability.""     He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a ""gradual and painstaking"" process, varying from country to country.     Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy, Baker said attitudes in debtor nations have changed and there is much greater acceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.     Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflation programs. Others, like the Philippines and Chile, are privatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.     The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile, have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major debtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have rescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the Paris club, while commercial banks are making new loans.     Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70 billion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile, Venezuela and Mexico.     Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progress industrial nations are making in promoting moderate global growth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade imbalances.     He maintained world economic conditions were ""continuuing to improve"" a development that would provide a positive backdrop for debtor nations.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Addressing Argentine businessman during the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) meeting here, he said the two sides will meet again next Thursday in New York.     ""We have made significant progress over the last 30 days and we should have an agreement in a shorter lapse of time than managed by Mexico, Venezuela or Chile,"" he said.     Brodersohn reiterated that Argentina's goal is to reach an agreement which permits four pct growth this year, following last year's 5.5 pct and negative growth in 1985.     He said discussions were still continuing on debt-capitalization plans and schemes for on-lending, in the light of certain Argentine concerns.     The government is anxious that debt that is capitalized should represent new investment in the country on a dollar invested per dollar capitalized basis, rather than a simple transfer of ownership of the debt, he said.     At the same time, it wants to avoid an expansionary monetary impact from on-lending schemes, whereby debt repayments are recycled by banks into new loans.     Brodersohn said also agreement was close on the proposal for so-called exit bonds, whereby creditors can sell out their debt.     Argentina's 1987 financing needs come to 3.53 billion dlrs, including the 2.15 billion from banks and a 1.38 billion dlr IMF loan already agreed. It is projecting a current account deficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.     It estimates export earnings will have dropped by 7.1 billion dlrs between 1985-87 as a result of falling commodity prices.

At a press conference here, Paul Dreyer, the company's product manager for the drug, said physicians must submit an enrollment application to the company for each new patient who is a candidate for taking the drug.     The company is the U.S. arm of Wellcome Plc.     The application will list several items required to evaluate a patient. The company will inform doctors within one week if a patient meets enrollment criteria and whether there are sufficient amounts of the drug available.     On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for wide clinical use. The drug is not a cure for AIDS, but it does prolong the lives of certain people with AIDS, who have a history of certain types of pneumonia, and patients with an advanced form of AIDS-related complex whose immune systems have declined after infection with the virus.     The company said it only has enough supply of the drug to treat 15,000 patients and by the end of the year should have enough supply to treat 30,000 patients.     Dreyer said physicians can call 1-800-843-9388 for information about distribution of the drug, and pharmacists can call 1-800-322-1887 to place orders for the drug.     Dreyer added this distribution system will end once an adequate supply of the drug is available.     Thomas Kennedy, vice president of corporate affairs, declined to comment on the cost of developing the drug.     Some organizations have criticized the high cost of the drug, which is said to be between 7,000 and 10,000 dlrs per year for treatment. Dreyer said it took seven months to make the drug, and the company obtained the principal raw material from Pfizer Inc <PFE>.     Dryer said the company is developing other suppliers.

Zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billion dlrs referred to principal or interest or both. Yugoslavia's hard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.     Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticised Yugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having real interest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability to control monetary policy and slow pace of reform.     He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMF commission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.

391," INDEX TRADING NOT TO BLAME FOR WALL STREET FALL     WASHINGTON, March 23 - A report by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded that index trading was not to blame for the two-day stock market drop that occurred Sept. 11-12, 1986     The report, made public today, concluded that index trading magnified but was not the cause of last fall's two-day 120-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.     The commission staff said it planned to continue to closely monitor developments in index-related trading but planned no immediate regulatory action as a result of the precipitous stock market decline.     ""The magnitude of the September decline was a result of changes in investors' perceptions of fundamental economic conditions, rather than artifical forces arising from index-related trading strategies,"" the report said.     ""Nevertheless, index-related futures trading was instrumental in the rapid transmission of these changed investor perceptions to individual stock prices, and may have condensed the time period in which the decline occurred.""     The SEC staff concluded its study ""does not provide an independent basis to conclude that radical regulatory or structural changes are necessary at this time.""     The report said ""the dramatic growth in the size and institutional use of index products requires continued careful analysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market as well as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in the index products and their component stocks.""     It said there ""may be merit"" to requiring additional reporting and record keeping procedures for index-related trading. But it added that the SEC staff has not yet considered the costs and benefits of the various alternatives.     The report does not deal with a second precipitous dip in the market which occurred Jan. 23.     On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 115 points in little more than an hour.     The SEC said its staff was still analyzing the underlying causes of that price decline and had not yet made findings.     The SEC study was made after a number of investors, news reports and other analysts blamed the Sept. 11-12 drop on so-called ""program trading,"" in which computers rapidly execute complex trading strategies designed to profit from minute changes in the relationship between the price of stock index futures and the stocks that make up the index.     The investors and analysts complained that such rapid movements in the stock market would drive small investors out of the market and possible even lead to a stock market crash.     But the SEC report said the possibility of a market collapse was ""remote.""     It said it believed any rapid stock price decline ""likely"" would eventually be reversed by renewed buying as prices reached far lower levels.     It also argued that index futures and options are important to traders who use them to hedge their market positions and lessen risk exposure.     ""While a 'cascade effect' may be possible as a result of index-related trading, it did not ocur on Sept. 11 and 12,"" the report concluded.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

399," PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER     LISBON, March 23 - Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders.     Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders.     Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.     As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.     Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part."" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.     Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.     ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"" Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.     The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987 crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.     Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy.     Sen.

Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments.     Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures.     Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices.

413," TEXACO <TX> SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE OF JUDGE'S BIAS     WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., March 23 - Texaco Inc said it has filed a motion with the Texas Court of Appeals to supplement the court record with new evidence it has just received of alleged bias by Judge Anthony J.P. Farris against Texaco and its chief trial lawyer in its litigation with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.     The company contended that the alleged bias provides clear grounds for a new trial. It said the motion was filed in connection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending in that court.     Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written by Farris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late 1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trial began.     The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosity against Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller, due to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from the case. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a 10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief trial lawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assigned to him, Texaco said.     In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grant Texaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.     Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearing on the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, and the application will be filed on March 30.     The company said it will ask the court to reconsider its decision on the issue of due process in light of the Farris letters.     In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billion dlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil's proposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken over by Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.     A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of the letters for some time but were unable to release them until now due to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneys from which they were secured.

415," TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED     LONDON, March 23 - Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.     The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.     The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.     The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.     The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said.     The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.     The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said.     The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets.     Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.     Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.     Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin ""ring-out"" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

420," U.S. PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS     By CHARLES ALDINGER, Reuters     WASHINGTON, March 23 - The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the  Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.     ""We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers"" to ship their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. ""But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,"" the official said.     The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf.     ""We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,"" one official said.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.     White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.     But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.     ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world,"" he said on NBC television's ""Meet the Press.""     The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran.      Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.     An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.     ""In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region,"" he was quoted as saying.

The company needs the exemptions from the U.S. Department of Energy to allow it to build the combined cycle generating units Chesterfield 7 and 8.  Chesterfield 7, a 210 megawatt unit planned for service in June 1990 at a cost of about 130 mln dlrs, would initially burn natural gas. Companion unit Chesterfield 8 would be built by June 1992.     Dominion said the coal group withdrew its opposition to the plants after Dominion said it would be willing to pursue installation of a coal gasifier for Chesterfield under proper economic conditions, so that the units could burn coal gas.

Juan Lechin Oquendo, the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization, COB, told reporters: ""I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike"".     Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro.     The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay.     About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia's minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said.     ""I will take part in the miners' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast,"" Lechin told reporters.     The COMIBOL miners' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry.     About 20,000 miners, or two-thirds of the working force, have been laid off through the government's decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price.     The government, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has called the miners' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who began a four-day visit last Friday.     ""I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike,"" Lechin told reporters. ""I also have to orga- nise the strike.""     Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez, the miners' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast, union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The EC has special trading and aid agreements with 66 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This includes a program called STABEX under which it provides aid to export-dependent countries if export earnings drop too much.     Senegal received about 155 mln European Currency Units (176 mln dlrs) between 1975 and 1984 mainly to compensate for a fall in its peanut export earnings.     The Ivory Coast received 108 mln ECUs (123 mln dlrs) and Ghana received 91 mln ECUs (104 mln dlrs) mostly to make up for a drop in coffee and cocoa export earnings.     Under the EC's STABEX aid program (export earnings stabilisation system), the Community provides special financial assistance to developing countries if export earnings in certain raw materials fall below an established level.     The EC provided about 1.06 billion ECUs (1.21 billion dlrs) in STABEX aid from 1975 to 1984, including 273 mln ECUs (311 mln dlrs) for losses in peanut exports, 261 mln ECUs (298 mln dlrs) for coffee and 150 mln ECUs (171 mln dlrs) for cocoa.

438," TECHNOLOGY/ATT'S <T>  EFFORTS TO SELL COMPUTERS     By Catherine Arnst, Reuters     BOSTON, March 23 - American Telephone and Telegraph Co is another illustration of a maxim already learned by several other huge corporations - that success in one segment of the electronics industry is very difficult to translate into success selling computers.     ATT is learning the hard way that all the resources and technological advances in the world can not make up for weak marketing and sluggish responses to one of the most rapidly changing and competitive industries.     Consequently, ATT will try again this week to convince the world that it is serious about computers, after four years in the business, by announcing a set of new products and showcasing its latest computer chief, Vittorio Cassoni, formerly of ATT's Italian affiliate Ing. C. Olivetti and Co.     Industry consultants said ATT will announce a faster addition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivity products, a new version of its Unix software operating system and assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.     The announcements, however, hold ""minimal significance"" for both ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultant John McCarthy. ""They are just never going to be a significant player in this market as long as computers play a subjagated role to the (telephone) network,"" he said.     ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984 and still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States, has only been able to carve out a fractional share of the computer industry.     Last year was particularly disastrous for the company's data systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating loss for the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a 1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge against earnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).     Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced its work force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of 290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computer division is particularly bad, especially since the computer merged its computer and network sales forces.     Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300 personal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months of the year after gaining some five pct of the market.     ""ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300,"" said consultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. ""There were no major product enhancements last year and a perception developed in the marketplace that the product was tired.""     Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressive competition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on price and offered more technologically advanced machines. ""I would have to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum on the pc side,"" said DeWitt.     The 3B line of minicomputers has never found great acceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system, though loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put a serious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted by industry giant International Business Machines Corp <IBM>.     By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying to defuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon or sell off the computer division and the company turned over all responsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which its owns a 23.5 pct stake.     But analysts said the company's image was dealt another blow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards, who preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division, announced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, a small developer of systems to manage networks.     Several other executives have also left in recent months, including John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And, although the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience running Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts expressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.     Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success in both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and it is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product that does not meet those profitability goals.      The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that it may not give certain products enough time to become established and customers may be reluctant to buy a product that could be discontinued in a year or two.     ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative view of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two year goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn around within five years.     Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating ""to the womb, going back to our old business"" of long distance telephone systems at the expense of the computer division.

439," IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS     By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF, Reuters     BAGHDAD, March 23 - Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.     The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.     The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade.     A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front.     It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.

440," TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL <WEN>     By Patti Domm, Reuters     New York, March 23 - Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor.     Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more than three mln shares.     Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible.     Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.     Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's official.     ""It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,"" said Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.     However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors.     Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them.     ""I can't put another name on it,"" said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy's stock. ""It very well could be someone's interested.""     But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time for Wendy's to be sold.     ""They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the right time,"" Freedman said.     ""If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control the situation,"" Freedman said.     ""I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't think it's worth much more than where it is,"" said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney.     Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the ""burger wars"" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's <PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said.     Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.     There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be vulnerable to a takeover.     James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.     ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants,"" Murren said.     Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in seven quarters,"" he said.     Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy's. ""My gut feeling is something's going to happen. I don't know what,"" she said.     She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share.     One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi.     Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

443," GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES DRAWN INTO VW CASE     By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters     FRANKFURT, March 23 - West Germany's banking authorities are being drawn into the currency scandal surrounding Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations in the financial community widen, banking sources said.     The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts to help the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud at Volkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.     The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin also is considering press allegations that several banks ""parked"" open positions with VW, breaching banking regulations.     Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurred potential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involving the hedging of open currency positions.     The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bank corporation would not normally attract the attention of West German banking regulators.     Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after the Herstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.     ""This strict banking supervision aims to protect special interests -- creditors and depositors,"" the Bundesbank spokesman said, adding company shareholders were not covered.     ""The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen's normal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area of the Bundesbank,"" he said.     The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert to Brunswick to help investigations into activities involving Volkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of the normal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.     The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor's staff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.     But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved in allegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.     Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the close of business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of their capital and reserves in open positions.     The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in 1974 due to currency speculation.     The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday that about 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section 1a by ""parking"" such excess open positions with VW.     This would mean that the bank concerned would sell the position temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.     However, such repurchase agreements are expressly included in section 1a as still counting as open positions.     A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin said it was following the allegations but investigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not been named. He declined to say what steps were being taken.     But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as an initial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identity of the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Brief declined comment.     If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the banking regulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case with the assistance of the Bundesbank.     The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does not have branches outside Berlin.     The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches in West Germany, closely monitoring local banks.     Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data, once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations at federal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).     Currency dealers said parking excess positions with non-banking corporates was frequent practice.     Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/next delivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next day at the same rate.     A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertake currency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.     He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging. German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.     The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have been possible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging given the company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.     VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibility and resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and fired its former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard ""Bobby"" Junger.     Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony today marking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes did not mean any of those involved was guilty.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

445," EC COMMISSION SET TO DETAIL GRAIN IMPORT PLAN     BRUSSELS, March 23 - The EC Commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States, Commission sources said.     Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.     All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries.     The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports.     There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax could be imposed later, the sources added.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.

460," SWISS BANKERS ANNOUNCE CURBS ON BANKING SECRECY     By Peter Conradi, Reuters     ZURICH, March 23 - Swiss bankers announced a series of measures aimed at preventing abuses of the country's tight banking secrecy laws as part of a revision of a 10-year-old voluntary code of conduct.     The measures follow renewed controversy over the limits of Swiss secrecy, prompted by recent allegations that both former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and U.S. Officials linked with the arms-for-Iran scandal had accounts here.     The Swiss Bankers Association said it wanted to curb the right of bank clients to hide their identity behind lawyers.     The association said it would insist that banks identify anyone doing cash business at the counter worth more than 100,000 francs, down from a current 500,000.     Banks would continue to be required to identify their clients in other cases and pledge not actively to help capital flight, or tax fraud. They would also still face fines of up to 10 mln francs in case of abuse.     ""The Bankers Association is convinced that this new agreement will give the banks an instrument which will guarantee banking secrecy and help the standing of Swiss banking both home and abroad,"" the statement said.     The code, once approved by member banks, will go into force on October 1. The original dates from 1977.     Controversy surrounding the alleged use and then freezing of bank accounts here linked with Marcos and with the U.S. Arms-for-Iran scandal have again directed attention on the revision of the code.     The recent busting of a major international drug ring also gave fresh evidence Swiss banks had been used for ""laundering"" drug money.     The Banking Commission, responsible for overseeing the banks, said at the end of last year it wanted a drastic reduction in clients' ability to hide behind lawyers and fiduciary agents, a proposal criticised by lawyers.     Steering a middle way, the association said today that lawyers doing banking business on behalf of clients would in future have to pledge they were not doing so merely to preserve the clients' identity nor only for a short period of time.     Until now, lawyers have only been obliged to sign a form pledging that their clients are not misusing their anonymity for illegal purposes.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several banks, citing Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt and the absence of a coherent economic plan, have already said they might take such a step, even though it would cost them tens of millions of dollars in profits.     An inconclusive meeting here March 22 between central bank governor Francisco Gros and Brazil's bank advisory committee can only have stiffened that resolve.     A nasty row is also looming over 16 billion dlrs of trade and money-market lines which Brazil froze last month.     The legal commitment to maintain these credits runs out on March 31, and the worried talk at the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting here is that some disgruntled bank will sue for repayment, raising the specter of a cascade of lawsuits and tit-for-tat asset seizures.     ""My gut feeling is that common sense will prevail. But is there a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,"" one New York banker commented.     Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world's largest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock waves through the financial markets. But no longer.     Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in the immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in the Eurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most sensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight out of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.     In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in part or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about 150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380 billion.     Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.     The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new bank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as banks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result, exposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for the collapse of a major bank.     That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp <CCI> felt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put Brazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days overdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as a result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in 1986 the setback would be manageable.     Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a protracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously erode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other debtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.     Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financing agreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, an accord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and a deal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring could be reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.     In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, the banks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. ""All of us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system - a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.     Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalization of interest is already happening in practice and that the banks ought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors on longer-term solutions that recognize that not all the interest can be paid back right away.     Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks from seriously considering adding interest to the principal of a loan because they would have to declare the loan non-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said, if the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they might be more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.     ""It's not necessarily an unfavorable development,"" Gros said when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being put on a cash basis.     ""We find more room to discuss these things (innovations) with European banks which have already bitten the bullet.""      What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry and frustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quick concessions.     A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead.

484," A H ROBINS <QRAH> SEEKS ORDER     RICHMOND, Va, March 23 - A.H. Robins Co said it filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond seeking to  establish an orderly procedure to determine the number of valid Dalkon Shield claims that must be dealt with in the company's Chapter 11 case.     The order would prescribe procedures for the filing and disposition of objections to certain claims, it said.     Robins said that 200,000 of the 327,000 claims it has received should be disallowed.     Robins said the claims are invalid because they are duplicates, the claimant is claiming injury from a product other than the Dalkon shield, claimants did not complete court-required questionnaires by June 30, 1986, or the claims were made beyond the April 30, 1986 deadline.     Robins has sought bankruptcy protection since August 1985 following a flood of lawsuits relating to its intrauterine Dalkon Shield, alleged to have caused uterine perforations, sterility, spontaneous abortions and death.      About 3.3 mln of the shields were sold in over 80 countries between 1971 and 1974, including 2.2 mln in the U.S. before it was withdrawn from the market.     A spokesman said Robins has been told to withhold refilng a reorganization plan pending the determination by a court-appointed examiner whether other parties are interested in acquiring Robins.     It had intended to file a plan in February, but received a purchase bid which was later withdrawn from American Home Products Corp.     American Home products never disclosed details of the proposed acquisition bid but analysts speculated that American Home would provide about 1.5 billion dlrs for a separate trust fund to handle the liability claims.     Robins said that establishing a procedure for identifying invalid claims is vital to establishing a plan of reorganization.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also on the list of possible replacements are two current SEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.     Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequently placed on the short list of Shad's possible successors were Kevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, who served about eight months in the Senate in 1981.     Brady, currently a managing partner with the New York investment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was an interim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) after Williams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy was SEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.     However, congressional sources speculated Brady may be unwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign.     The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements for Shad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.     Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SEC appointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.     Sen.

505," IBM <IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST     NEW YORK, March 23 - International Business Machines Corp, hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.     ""There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not until later this year,"" Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm.     Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.     IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs.     Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company itself, have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM's growth.     But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view. ""By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,"" he said of DEC's line of VAX computers.     In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named ""Fort Knox"" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.     Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. ""The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business.""     He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.     High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.     By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs.     Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area.     In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than stealing market share from one another.

Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.     Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog stood at 425 mln dlrs.

The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program ""dilemma"" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an ""umbrella"" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said ""the competitive problem is the most severe."" He said USDA is still studying the situation and ""no resolution"" has yet been found.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""We were able to make considerable headway,"" Hockin told reporters following a six-hour meeting with provincial ministers responsible for financial institutions.     Hockin said he was optimistic an agreement could be reached by the June 30 deadline to bring the sweeping new system in place, but he was willing to extend it if necessary.     Under the proposed system the traditional barriers separating the banking, securities and life insurance sectors will be removed and, for the first time, cross ownership will be allowed.     But a jurisdictional dispute over who regulates the new institutions has broken out between the provinces and Ottawa. The provinces have traditionally had authority over securities while Ottawa held sway over banking.     Hockin, without giving details, said under the new system the regulatory system would have to be harmonized to ""insure orderly and efficient markets.""     Hockin said he made it clear to the provinces that Ottawa has jurisdiction in any international accords in the financial sector and would not allow any intrusion by the provinces in that area.     Hockin said the ministers did not have time to go into detail on all the issues and the talks would continue the rest of this week at the official level.                    Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

547," BAKER SAYS LATINS BALK AT U.S. IADB COMPROMISE     MIAMI, March 23 - U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said leading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S. compromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-American Development Bank.     In an interview with a small group of reporters, Baker said discussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resume around the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in two weeks time.     But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would not disclose, was no longer on the table.     ""I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I expected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this meeting,"" Baker said.     The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans which were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.     In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy, Washington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine billion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the Bank.     In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending.     Baker said, ""In my view, they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.""     A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective four-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.     The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion dlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callable capital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place in practice, U.S. officials explained.     In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending.     Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with a loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual veto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.     But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at one point ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5 pct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that would amount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin American positions.     Baker said, ""In my view, they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.""     Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept the plan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, but he added, ""It's possible the proposal could be revived.""     U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said they believed a decision was not forthcoming because several top Latin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual meetings here.     And one official added that the key Latin officials would be present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.     The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left unresolved ""we can't look towards a greater (capital) replenishment here.""     That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral development bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehicle for lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor nations.     The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than sectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has never fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan.

American Express also approved the previously announced plan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.     American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.     American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January, 1999.    American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed.     American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.     American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding.     The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected in April.     American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London.     The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management, market research and consulting on financing. It also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to future personnel exchanges.     Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government approvals.     American Express said that assuming conversion of the preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson Lehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public offering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment option to purchase 1.8 mln shares.     American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at 100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding.     Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an adviser to the American Express board of directors.

562," CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT     By Nelson Graves, Reuter     BOCA RATON, Fla., March 23 - Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee.     ""The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,"" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.     ""We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,"" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. ""One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.""     As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange.     Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations.     ""They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.""     The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called ""triple-witching"" day.     ""We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,"" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said.     Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.     Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.     The changes ""will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,"" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year.     Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program.     The CME also received ""many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,"" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit.  Reuter ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

568," SPRINT OPTIMISTIC DESPITE LOSSES     By Peter Elsworth     DALLAS, March 23 - US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year.      David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost ""about 500 mln dlrs.""      He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over ""two plus years"" to set up its network.      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines.      He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now ""in the ground,"" and 7,000 miles are operable.      By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter.     Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.      ""By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,"" Holland said.     He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.      Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.      At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January.     ""We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,"" he said.      Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT ""should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.""      ""They're so dominant in the market place,"" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when ""there is true competition in the marketplace.""      ""It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,"" he said, adding, ""maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.""     Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.      ""They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,"" he said, adding that he was ""amazed"" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. ""There's no evidence of that,"" he said.      He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even ""ahead in many areas.""     Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.     ""We want to be in every country that ATT serves,"" he said.     He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it.      He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone network.

He said in a parliamentary debate, ""I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.""     Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point.     During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that ""during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.""     He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.     Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

584," CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U.K. OUTPUT     LONDON, March 24 - British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows.     The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged.     The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977.     In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.     The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal.     This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.     In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively.     Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.     In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March.     On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February.     From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier.     Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports.     ""But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home,"" he said.

Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.""     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.""  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

594," SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT     By Allan Ng, Reuters     HONG KONG, March 24 - Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.     Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.     They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May.     Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.     Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its ""A"" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.     Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said.     The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in <Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay.     Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic.     Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct.     Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.     Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.     ""Much depends on properties,"" said Measor. ""And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.""     Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.     Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects.     Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986.     During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said.     ""At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,"" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year.     The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.     Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.

Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986.     Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.     Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising reserves were ""a big headache for Taiwan.""     He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S.     Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S.     Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang's remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. ""We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,"" he said.     He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.     Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.     He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details.     The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0
597," AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY     SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 24 - Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.     He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.     Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation.     Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years.     These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said.     The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.     ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.     He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.     As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects.     APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.     Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.""     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     ""Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round,"" he said.     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"" he said.

Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year.     ""A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,"" he said.     Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.     Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.     ""It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,"" he said.     ""The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,"" he said.     Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.     Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.

600," SUPERCONDUCTOR RESEARCH MAY BOOST TOKYO STOCKS     By James Kynge, Reuters     TOKYO, March 24 - Research into materials that conduct electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains on Tokyo's booming stock market, brokers said.     They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week after publication of articles about the research in the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The companies were in the non-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.     But industry analysts said development problems remain and commercial application is still some years away.     ""The area clearly has significant applications but it won't be commercially viable for a few years,"" said Thomas Murtha, technology analyst with James Capel and Co.     Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can be overcome.     Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry, electricity generation and storage, and scientific research.     The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.     Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T> predicted in an in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth 150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50 billion for those used in electricity generators and 150 billion for those used in electricity storage.     The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable of 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered mainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of superconducting material would be needed for such a train.     The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used in nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.     Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial applications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum electrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen, which is much less expensive, has recently also been used successfully, they said.     Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.     From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's close, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMI.T> share price rose 140 yen to 485 yen.     In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp <MITM.T>, rose 95 to 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd <TOMM.T> rose 200 to 1440 yen, and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260.     Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares <URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to 689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd <FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.     Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments needed to conduct the superconductor research also rose.     Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor, made from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors.     Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.     Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.     Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.     In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets.     In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he said.     He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.

Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     ""It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,"" Sumita said.     The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

It said in a statement the Santos bid was below the underlying value of the shares as assessed by Macquarie Hill Samuel at between 4.08 dlrs and 4.72.     TMOC, formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd, said the valuation was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of 2.55 dlrs a share by <Elders Resources Ltd>. Elders Resources holds 19.9 pct of TMOC's 62 mln shares.     TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources' response to the bid or that of its other major shareholder the <Australian Gas Light Co>. The latter has a 10.5 pct stake in TMOC.     <Avalon Corp> of the U.S. Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC through an option agreement.     Santos, which is 15 pct owned by Elders Resources, yesterday said its bid valued TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs.

617," WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542.2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS     LONDON, March 24 - Industrial holding company Williams Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.     The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share     Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p.     A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash alternative.     The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations.     The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.     Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.     Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it centred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.     Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading.     In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln     Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln.     The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share.     The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.     Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or 0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.     There was no immediate response from Norcros.  REUTER ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

620," DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER     By Kunio Inoue, Reuters     TOKYO, March 24 - The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said.     Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said.     ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division.     He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency.     ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.     Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency.     They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York.     Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen.     ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.     He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.     But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.     ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.     In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax.     In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.     Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

622," AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN     SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 24 - The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure.     The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.     As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum.     APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said.     It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.     Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.     ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,"" the APEA council said.     The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said.     The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

626," CHINA EXPECTED TO SHOW BIG 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT     By Mark O'Neill, Reuters     PEKING, March 24 - China's Finance Minister Wang Bingqian will report a 1986 budget deficit of up to nine billion yuan and prescribe austerity measures for 1987 in a budget speech on Thursday, foreign bankers and diplomats told Reuters.     Chinese officials have said the 1986 deficit is ""several billion,"" after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followed six years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuan shortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.     The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in fixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state firms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.     ""China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production while cutting expenditure,"" the official Peking Review said in an editorial yesterday.     ""China should institute means for the effective control of the macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger ones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and reduced consumption,"" it said.     Only by such measures, the magazine said, ""can an overall supply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy develop steadily over a long period.""     A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit, which he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in efficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and taxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.     The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits and taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to 119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget, losses rose and product quality was unstable.     The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of bad management and rapid changes in external conditions.     ""For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free market, where prices are up to double those for materials they buy under fixed quota from the state,"" the diplomat said.     ""The firms are not subject to proper market discipline, because they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank loans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them. Under these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the economic levers the state is introducing,"" he said.     Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand in the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of industrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.     ""He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting government expenditure,"" he said. ""China's economy is inherently unstable, either in a high or a trough.""     He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since the start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting investment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to bring demand and supply into balance.     ""There will be no surprises,"" the diplomat said.     The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was the lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese industrial city.     ""Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys to feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs, with one banquet given by them and one given in return by me. But there was none on this visit,"" he said.     He added economic reforms will slow this year, in particular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise sensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues raise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.     A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about eight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a national drive against ""bourgeois liberalism,"" a phrase meaning Western political ideas.     ""In China the political system dictates economic policy,"" he said. ""The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat the reformers and demand more economic austerity.     ""One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week 1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less overseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be sourced internally.""     The banker said he is more comfortable about China's stability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched after the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.     ""There is no leftist alternative to the reforms,"" he said. ""There is no going back to the policy of strict central control. But the reforms will take years. What you have now is a confused mix of control and market economies.""  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
627," NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND     By Steven Brull, Reuters     TOKYO, March 24 - Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said.     The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,"" he said.     ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,"" Smithson said.  REUTER ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.     Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate.     Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.     It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.     Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs.     Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.     Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year.     Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.     Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.     But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.     ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"" Massy-Green said.

632," INDONESIAN BANKS PROFITS RISE AFTER DEVALUATION     By Jeremy Clift, Reuters     JAKARTA, March 24 - Indonesia's September devaluation helped bank profits to rise by 28.6 pct in calendar 1986, but despite higher world oil prices, banks are likely to see profits stabilise or fall in 1987, the head of Indonesia's Association of Private Banks told Reuters.     Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview that most banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluation against the U.S. Dollar.     He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable for Indonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.     But he forecast that overall bank profits would probably fall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said were artificially high due to the devaluation.     The Association's latest report on the performance of Indonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows that overall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385 billion in 1985.     This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9 billion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.     The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986, mostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.     Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp <BAC.N>, was affected by a string of bad debts and other problems during the year. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a loss of 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.     A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of America in Jakarta was now back on track. ""The worst is behind us.""     Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986 from 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.     Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed to operate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2 billion in 1985, the report said.     These profits do not include offshore loans, which are handled through other centres but which account for most of the foreign banks' business.     Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which account for more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharply to 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.     Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from 31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.     Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to 63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.     Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552 billion at the end of December 1985.     Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgeted government spending will fall in real terms. Many ministries have had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.     ""This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,"" Muna stated. ""But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, the general performance of the banking sector will not be too bad.""     Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish, but Indonesia was using more foreign loans.     Bank of Tokyo <BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed to operate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billion rupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But its profit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.     Citicorp's <CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listed as the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behind Bank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a 1985 profit of 11.9 billion.     A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was a book-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, but declined to give further figures.     One western banker said that ""Citibank is still definitely the largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not its profit figures show it.""     Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms of assets of all banks in Indonesia.     The government allows only 11 foreign banks to conduct full banking operations, and restricts their business to Jakarta.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

634," CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN     TAUPO, New Zealand, March 24 - Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     ""The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,"" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.     ""Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,"" he added in an interview with Reuters.     ""In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,"" he said.     Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a ""shining act of faith"" in the world trade system.     Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.     He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples.     He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The financing will be for seven years, with four years grace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in U.S. Dollars. The credit will be transferable and carry interest at 1-1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. There is a commitment fee of 1/2 pct.     Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50 basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.     The terms represent an improvement over those obtained last year, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlr transferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity but had interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility was subsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.     However, the loan was not signed until November 5, and bankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have the financing in place early to give it greater flexibility in drawing the funds over the course of the year.     Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowings with a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.     At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox, advisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking to make greater use of the international capital markets to reduce the country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.     However, bankers believe this will be the country's only major financing for this year, although another small private placement in Japan could be arranged later in the year.

Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     ""It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,"" Sumita said.     The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged.     The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977.     In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.     The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal.     This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.     In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively.     Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.     In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March.     On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February.

661," YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM     By Graham Hillier, Reuters     TAUPO, New Zealand, March 24 - U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.""     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package.""  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0
662," NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE     TOKYO, March 24 - Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.     At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors.     Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.     Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.     Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.     In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets.     In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

663," DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER     By Kunio Inoue, Reuters     TOKYO, March 24 - The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said.     Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said.     ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division.     He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency.     ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.     Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency.     They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York.     Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen.     ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.     He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.     But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.     ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.     In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax.     In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.     Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

665," NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND     By Steven Brull, Reuters     TOKYO, March 24 - Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said.     The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,"" he said.     ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,"" Smithson said.  REUTER ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
666," CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN     TAUPO, New Zealand, March 24 - Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     ""The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,"" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The sources said Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin made the proposal to a 12-bank advisory committee, chaired by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co as the talks entered their fourth week in New York.     They said the Philippines was now willing to pay a spread of 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (Libor), up from the 5/8 points it originally proposed.     The sources said the proposal was made in a bid to break a deadlock with the banks, who were insisting on a minimum interest spread of one full percentage point over Libor.     They noted that the latest plan marked a compromise between the two sides' demands, but fell short of Ongpin's assertion that the Philippines would insist on a deal better than the 13/16 percentage points offered to Mexico last year by its creditor banks.     The sources added that two key members of the negotiating team returned to Manila last night, indicating agreement was likely to be hammered out by this weekend.     The sources said Finance Undersecretary Ernest Leung and Deputy Central Bank Governor Edgardo Zialcita left New York after Ongpin and Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez started talks with the banks to put finishing touches to the accord.     ""The talks are now in a make-or-break phase,"" the sources said. ""All that is left are the wrinkles -- unless some bank again decides to hang tough.""

But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency officials said.     The officials told reporters industrial production, down 0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook.     The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct in the previous quarter.     A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the officials said.     They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction.     Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels, the officials said.     They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in the January/March quarter from the October/December quarter.     ""But the problem is imports are not expanding,"" said one official.

The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit.     Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made ""Silkworm"" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West.     Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.     White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran.     Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday.

Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22.     The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.     Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.     The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks.     However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.     The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred.     Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday.

""Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and accessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck,"" he told Le Figaro in an interview.     He said that the majority of French business leaders were enthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an opportunity rather than a danger for their companies.     ""It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much better than we could achieve in isolation. We know that we have to reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous problems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to unemployment,"" Perigot added.

The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc <DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most profitable retailing group in the U.K.     It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.

The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component.     The company said that the improvement had been achieved by substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.     In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.

709," SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY     TOKYO, March 24 - Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations.     Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     ""It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,"" Sumita said.     The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

The company said each unit of securities would consist of 1.25 common shares in the new company and three dlrs principal amount of the new company's 11 pct subordinated debentures due 1997.     It said the 16.50 dlr cash alternative is an improvement over the 15.00 dlr per share price contemplated under an agreement in principle with Welsh Carson announced on March Five.     Comdata said the cash and securities alternaitcve is subject to Welsh Carson-affiliated investors owning at least 60 pct of the stock of the new company.     The company said investment bankers <Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc> and Alex. Brown and Sons Inc <ABSB> found the proposal to be fair from a financial point of view.

713," DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT     By Franz-Josef Ebel, Reuters     FRANKFURT, March 24 - The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said.     ""The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention,"" one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market.     But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further.     Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further.     ""The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range,"" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said.     Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. ""Window-dressing"" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency.     Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down.     ""Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared,"" one dealer said.     The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact.     But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act.     While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated.     The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.     ""The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,"" one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done.     Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.     ""It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,"" a dealer said. Another added, ""If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.""     Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.     ""It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,"" Citibank said.     It added, ""Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year.""     And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, ""We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.""     But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments.     ""There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down,"" a senior dealer said.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said.

Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.     A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.     The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.     ""Money supply control is the government's chief weapon against inflation,"" he said. ""The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad.""

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     ""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,"" he said. ""The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.""     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. ""Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.""     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     ""It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"" he said.

A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 is still continuing, despite a partial return to work.     A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strike headquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters that about 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.

Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Banco do Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.     Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse of the government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.

A draft act divides goods into three groups for VAT. Most will be taxed at 20 pct, although basic foods, urban transport, fuel, pharmaceuticals and probably homes and building materials will be zero-rated. Non-basic services will be taxed at 10 pct.     Several other taxes will be abolished when VAT comes in next January 1 and the effect will be to cut producer prices by between five and 10 pct, MTI said.     Consumer prices will rise by about eight pct as result of cuts in subsidies, including those on milk and dairy products, MTI said. It did not say what effect the VAT would have.     Basic changes in company taxation were necessary as varying taxes and subsidies gave a confusing picture, and minor steps taken so far had only improved things temporarily.     MTI said inefficient firms were still being maintained at the expense of efficient ones, whose profit incentive was blunted by an average profit tax of 80 pct. The idea was to give all ventures equal chances and eliminate distinctions.     ""Valid preferences or supports are to be withdrawn, or at least reduced,"" MTI said.     The tax changes will be a further step in a recent line of economic reforms designed to boost company efficiency.     Management of 75 pct of all state enterprises passed from ministries to elected enterprise councils in 1985 and 1986, and a bankruptcy law in force since last September limits the duty of the state to save loss-making firms.     MTI said yesterday state subsidies to enterprises and industrial cooperatives rose 16 pct last year, while profits rose 4.6 pct. It gave no absolute figures.     The number of small private ventures rose 4,000 to 39,000 in 1986. Their turnover rose 27.5 pct and net income 16.2 pct. They now employ 443,000, nine pct of the workforce.     Hungarians now pay no tax on their primary income, and relaxation of central economic controls has led to large disparities in earnings, almost entirely in the private sector.     MTI said the introduction of personal income tax for all workers would lead to a fairer bearing of the public burden. It gave no details of the tax structure except to say that it would be progressive and embrace all legal income.     All measures are due to go before parliament this summer.

745," U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH     By Donna Smith, Reuters     WASHINGTON, March 24 - The U.S. economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private economists say.     Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending.     But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some economists remain cautious about the outlook.     The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency said.     The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct.     The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.     The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct, the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.     The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.     Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending. He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units.     Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue.     Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.     The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar's value over the last year and half.     ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levy predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.     The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit, which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.     As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.     U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.     The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt.     The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.     There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986.     While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.     The government also reported that consumer spending, a key element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in February, after falling two pct in January.     The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.     In its latest report on current economic conditions, the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving. Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.     Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either.     He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power.     ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0
746," INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY     JAKARTA, March 24 - World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers.     ""We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,"" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta.     Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.     The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted.     But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.     ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half.     Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto.     He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.     ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world,"" he said.     The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.     The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.     The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.     Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

""If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be repeated for the Americans everywhere,"" he said.

Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway.     Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a Shell spokesman said.     Shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters.

Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985.     The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985.     Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company.     In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB.

A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 is still continuing, despite a partial return to work.     A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strike headquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters that about 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.     He said that many private banks were working, particularly in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.     The bankworkers, one of the best-organized sectors of Brazil's labour force, are striking for a 100 pct pay rise.     Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Banco do Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.     Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse of the government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.     According to official figures, prices rose by 33 pct in just the first two months of the year.     Other strikes are being threatened, including national stoppages by 450,000 social security workers and 50,000 university teachers.     In central Sao Paulo dozens of armed military police stood guard outside branches of the Banco do Brasil to preempt any move by bankworkers to occupy the buildings.     A bank official in one foreign bank, which was still open this morning, said that with the closure of the Banco do Brasil private banks would not be able to function much longer.     He said: ""If the Banco do Brasil closes it shuts down the whole system. I think that after lunch we will have to stop.""     Groups of strikers marched in the central commercial district, waving banners and stopping outside private banks to chant slogans.     Pires said the strike call had been largely ignored by workers in the private banks, with many branches open particularly in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.     Television reports said that in the southern state of Parana farmers protesting against high interest rates supported the bankworkers.

He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo that Indonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and cause for concern. But he said it was not necessarily due to imprudent borrowing and ""it is still within an area of being manageable.""     The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts of around 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to a projected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87 ending March 31.     Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.     Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise in the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio by reducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.     Indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes up almost one third of the 1987/88 budget.     Payment on the principal of government debts is officially projected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion in 1986/87.

Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was ""heavy and strong"" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry.     Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports.     In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp <MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. ""We intend to keep that debate open,"" Herrington said.     However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee ""is not economical.""     Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation's gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.     Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.

768," PHILIPPINE CENTRAL BANKER FACES CORRUPTION CHARGES     By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters     MANILA, March 24 - A government-appointed special prosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over the closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank governor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.     Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to indicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the closure of <Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.     He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed ""within the week"" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that a defendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.     Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines' creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the country's foreign debt.     A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific Bank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.     ""Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the appreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a motion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution,"" the statement said.     Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after Fernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is in Manila, conferred on the telephone.     Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after hearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, the president of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.     In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily in ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under receivership without giving the bank the right to appeal, throwing hundreds of employees out of work.     Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding in Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over Pacific Bank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January, 1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.     She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by appointing two Far East bank executives to central bank consultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She also disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts from January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a profit, not a loss.     The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing that Pacific Bank was ""repeatedly given notice of the continuing losses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up additional capital to eliminate insolvency.""     It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank of Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase Pacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed ""because of certain legal impediments.""     The statement said the central bank invited several banks to submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was approved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.     Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had divested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he became central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman declined comment on the charges against Fernandez.     In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending prosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie evidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then members of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far East executives, and ordered their investigation.     He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political climate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.     ""(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices was either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and his wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens ... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any instructions from above,"" Gonzalez wrote.     Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office had received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He said among those facing prosecution were five provincial governors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also affirmed were the Prime-2 commercial paper of Chrysler's finance arm and the Baa-1 guaranteed Eurobonds of Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd.

Fireman's Fund said it is cooperating with the SEC.

795," SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION     CAIRO, March 24 - Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.     Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods.     SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.     Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year.     In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.     Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.     Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today.     With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.     Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance.     The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.     This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments.     Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.     Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was ""very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.""     The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.     Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.     But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns, it said.

799," EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT     BRUSSELS, March 24 - Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.     Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.     The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities.     The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31.     But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.     The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.     However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates.     On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

814," U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION     WASHINGTON, March 24 - A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.     A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.     But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. ""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,"" he said.     The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.

The debt is covered by a standstill agreement that expires June 30.     Under the new accord, the standstill will be extended for three years to June 30, 1990.     There will be an immediate repayment of three pct to all the banks, to be followed by various payments at six-month intervals over the life of the agreement totalling some 1.5 billion dlrs.     The three pct payment will be due July 15, 1987. Subsequent repayments will be determined under a complex structure which will be based on the maturity structure of individual banks' loans, the bankers said.     The bankers, who declined to be identified, said the agreement also will give banks the option to convert their existing debt into term loans for 10-years, with five years grace.     An agreement reached last year allowed for the conversion of the short-term debt covered by the standstill into three-year loans.

819," LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT     LONDON, March 24 - <Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.     But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.     The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said.     As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.     Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln.     Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said.     Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said.     A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.     Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.     Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant.     The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.     Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.     Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.""     In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements.     A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said.     Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site.     Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for.     Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.     He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall.

Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage stocks, resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions.     ""The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of the value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to be a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the U.S.,"" said another analyst.     As globalization of the financial markets accelerates, Japanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the expertise of the U.S. brokerage industry.     Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market and Europe has also created a craving for more capital by U.S firms.     ""Morgan (Stanley), First Boston, Salomon (Brothers), Merrill (Lynch). Those would be the firms more likely to consider hooking up with a Japanese firm, and those would be the ones the Japanese would be most interested in,"" Eckenfelder said.     All of those firms, he said, have been establishing themselves in Japan.     While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably, there is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may learn enough from their U.S. partners to ultimately pose the same type of competitive threat they have made in electronics and automobiles.     ""The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to as markets deregulate. Passive investment is an education gathering period. Obviously, there are regulatory barriers toward exercising management control,"" said Samuel Liss, a brokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers.     The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approved by U.S. regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry. There will also be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson.     Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form a joint venture company in London to work on investment advisory, asset management, and consulting on financing.     Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium for its stake, but it will also receive warrants for one mln American Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson will be cumulative preferred, convertible to common after U.S. regulatory approval is granted.     American Express has also guaranteed it will retain a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990.     American Express and Nippon are also expected to work closely. For instance, analysts expect it to market the American Express card more actively in Japan with the help of Nippon.     ""The key to the deal is not just raising capital for Shearson, but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon,"" said Alan Zimmerman of Kidder, Peabody and Co.     American Express stock responded favorably to the announcements, climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today.     Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining a foothold in the U.S. market with the help of American Express and Shearson.     Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to follow Nippon Life. U.S. insurers have found numerous partners themselves in the brokerage industry.     For instance, Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp, and Prudential Life Insurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.     Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not be likely acquirors of U.S. firms for the time being, although they have often been rumored suitors in the past. Last year, when Shearson unsuccessfully courted E.F. Hutton Group <EFH>, Japanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller said, ""A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring"" as a guide to monetary policy.     ""In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary policy might be eased,"" he said.     Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give ""early warning"" signs of wholesale and retail changes.     ""There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis,"" Heller said in a prepared text.     ""But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy action might be considered,"" he said.     Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates.     Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he said.     He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy.  Reuter ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister Chu Okongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) chief executive Jack Gill.     The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateral talks tomorrow with Coface, the French export credit agency.     Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.     The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace.     But as with all Paris Club pacts, specific interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basis with the countries involved. None of the details contained in today's negotiations was immediately available.     The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can be struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export credit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria.     The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in 1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days, govenment sources said there had not been any discussions on new credits.     Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official agencies under a structrual adjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to support a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.     But these credits cannot be approved until the export credit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
881," DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U.S. DISTILLATE STOCKS     NEW YORK, March 24 - Tonight's American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.     They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels.     Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.     The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another  draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.     For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels.     Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.     U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.     Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week.     The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell.     The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20.     Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said.     Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

883," STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD     By Myra MacDonald, Reuters     LONDON, March 24 - The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.     Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.     While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates.     But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.     The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse.     ""On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses,"" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.     He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.     However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency.     Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said.     Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week's budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters.     Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.     Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound.     In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted.     U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling.     Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.     Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.     Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.     Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current account figures for February.     Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January's small surplus.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,1
884," U.S. EX-IM BANK TO CHANGE LENDING POLICIES     WASHINGTON, March 24 - The president of the Export-Import Bank said the Bank was changing its lending policies to reflect changing conditions in export financing.     President John Bohn told a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawn from financing exports and export projects were becoming smaller.     ""Exporters now need financing in riskier markets and on deals which are smaller, take longer to put together and close,"" Bohn said in his testimony. ""Lenders, however, want less risk, higher profit, transaction-oriented and less labor-intensive activities.     ""It became clear to us the EXimbank must assume a broader range of explicitly defined country and transaction risks than it has previously. Programs and procedures need to be simplified, streamlined and internally consistent,"" he said.     Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middle market product or service exporter and would have essentially one loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term and long-term export transactions.     ""Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, the maximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans will carry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rate schedule for the market and the term,"" he said.     Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion dlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrs may be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10 billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.     He said the Bank would have to come back to Congress later this year to discuss its capitalization needs.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Separately, ATT denied reports that it plans to buy back a large chunk of its stock. ATT's stock was up 1/4 points at 25-1/8 in heavy trading.     The company said it also created a separate 600-member team that will educate the computer sales force and its other sales groups on ATT's computer products. This group, ATT said, reports directly to Vittorio Cassoni, senior vice president of its computer unit, called the Data Systems division.     Cassoni, speaking at a news conference at which ATT unveiled its most powerful mid-range computer, said the sales groups will provide a ""sharper focus"" to ATT's computer marketing efforts.     The executive, hired from Olivetti to bolster ATT's unsuccessful campaign to become a major vendor of computer gear, also said the company is committed to its 3B line of mid-range computers. He said ATT backed the 3B line despite widespread criticism throughout the industry that it is inferior to mid-range systems made by International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> and others.     Cassoni, however, said ATT would strenghten the 3B line within the next three or four months. He said ATT will offer new, more powerful mid-range computers that will protect the investments of existing 3B users in ATT hardware and software.     In justifying the company's commitment to the 3B line, which was originally developed for internal use by ATT and its former Bell telephone company units, Cassoni pointed to several recent sales that he said proved the mid-range line's commercial viability.     One example he provided was a recent 34 mln dlr deal ATT signed with the United States Postal Service.     Cassoni also said ATT will announce a new personal computer based on the powerful 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp <INTC>.    Compaq Computer Corp <CPQ> is already selling a 386-based PC and IBM is widely expected to announce a 386 machine sometime this year.    Cassoni said the Data Systems division is unprofitable and that it will take ""a couple of years"" for the division to meet its goal of making a ""substantial contribution to ATT's earnings stream."" But, he added, the division is ""approaching"" the point where it can start making money.     Cassoni said the new products introduced today are ""a very significant step to foster our efforts in the computer business.""     Among the new offerings is the 3B2/600 minicomputer, which ATT said can provide up to four times the processing power of the 3B2/400, previously its biggest computer.     But with a top speed of 4.0 mips, or million instructions per second, the top-of-line 3B cannot match the computing power of rival systems from IBM and DEC.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

900," SOUTH AFRICA/BANKS AGREE ON DEBT REPAYMENT PLAN     PRETORIA, March 24 - South Africa will repay 13 pct of its frozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in London, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.     He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.    ""These arrangements confirm South Africa's continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,"" du Plessis told a news conference.     Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was ""substantially a continuation"" of the arrangement ending in June and calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of 23 billion dlrs.     The new debt standstill will extend from July 1, 1987, to June 30, 1990, with a three pct down payment permitted on July 15, 1987, ""provided such debt has already reached maturity,"" du Plessis said.     Finance Minister Barend du Plessis told a new conference that 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a ""good deal"" both for South Africa and the banks and added that the three-year length of the agreement was of ""enormous significance"" to South Africa.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a ""good deal"" both for South Africa and the banks.     Besides the 13-billion-dlr frozen debt, South Africa also owes ten billion dlrs of debt that includes a significant amount of medium -term liabilities that will continue to be repaid on normal maturity dates.     The 13 pct to be repaid under the standstill amounts to 1.42 billion dollars.     A total of five pct or 508 mln dlrs will be repaid in the second half of 1987, with 3.5 pct or 400 mln dlrs in calendar 1988, three pct or 346 mln dlrs in calendar 1989 and 1.5 pct or 166 mln dlrs in the first half of 1990.     Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London.     About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     De Kock, speaking at the same news conference, said the three-year length of the agreement was of ""enormous significance"" to South Africa.     De Kock said South Africa had negotiated from a ""position of basic economic financial strength.""     ""We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever heard of,"" he said.     Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months, and a continued current account surplus ""will be sufficient"" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.     Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the South African economy and country as a whole.     He attributed this to ""restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest.""     South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2,400 lives in the past three years.     Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors.     He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again ""taking a more realistic view"" of South Africa.

901," STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS     LONDON, March 24 - Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.     Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.     Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.     In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.     ""The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,"" Barber said.     He said, ""the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.""     Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made ""a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.""     He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was ""well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,"" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank ""showed continued growth.""     ""Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,"" he said.     Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.     Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices following the failure to re-introduce international coffee export quotas, but they said Colombia could compensate the drop with higher exports in calendar 1987.     Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs, according to the bank.     Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers' Federation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln dlrs for Colombia.     But he stressed that Colombia, with stockpiles of 10 mln (60-kg) bags, had the capacity to export more and would use a recently-introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so.

""The (blood banking) system is strong,"" Edwin Steane, president of the American Association of Blood Banks, said at a news briefing here.

The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a unit of Citicorp <CCI>, said it also obtained additional financing commitments, including an increased commitment from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.     The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for non-public information about Cyclops that was previously provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's published financial projections.     Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a 90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.     The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the consummation of Cyacq's offer.

The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts.     Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia.     The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn.     Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30.     Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year.     The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand.     It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.     Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800.     The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program.     The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30.     USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said.     USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters.     A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said.     ""A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now,"" he said.

942," ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET     By Keith Leighty     CHICAGO, March 24 - The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution.     The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs.     Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution.     The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.     Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.     But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.     With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op.     Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc.     Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis.     Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.     Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.     Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.     Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.     ""The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.""     One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits.     But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make folks gun-shy,"" Hanes said.     Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.     A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.""     ""We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said. ""But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.""     Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative.     ""In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but added, ""The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.""     Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. ""I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.""     In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed.     Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members.     Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.     ""You're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" Mulligan said. ""Lower volume translates into higher costs.""     According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.     Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year.     However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
943," CONRAC <CAX> SOARS FOLLOWING MARK IV <IV> BID     By Cal Mankowski, Reutersd     NEW YORK, March 24 - Heavy buying by speculators boosted Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>.     ""It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria,"" said one arbitrageur, referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per share and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knight willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.     For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed like an ""appropriate price."" Another said ""it's too early to project the outcome.""     ""The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate,"" the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.     He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV.     Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17.     A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. ""They're not beginners,"" he said.     Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. ""It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"" he said. ""There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it's presently structured.""     Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software, aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding equipment and other products.     ""I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk,"" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at Milwaukee Co.     He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV ""fair value but on the low side."" ""I don't think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer,"" he said.     Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets. He said management has done a good job of turning around the telephone answering machine business.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.     The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound.

Wainoco said it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of the two mln units consisting of two shares of common stock and one warrrant per unit for a total of four mln shares of common stock and two mln warrants.     Included in the two mln units to be offered are 280,000 shares of common stock to be sold by <Waverly Oil Co>,  a selling shareholder of Wainoco, it said.     Proceeds of the offering will be used to reduce bank debt, the company said. It said its outstanding 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay the exercise price of the warrants.     Wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  E.F. Hutton and Co Inc, Kidder Peabody and Co Inc, and Smith Barney harris Upham Inc.     Simultaneous with the offering, Wainoco said it intends to redeem its shareholder value rights attached to each common share at 10 cts per right. Wainoco said without redemption of the value rights, the company would not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the units offering.     Due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is contingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.     Wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributed to the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remain valid.     It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadian subsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset all of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its debenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.     Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions has been increased by an amount which should generate savings that will exceed existing deferred income tax liability.     Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S. are not materially affected, the company said. It added this will considerably reduce future income taxes in Canada and add to Wainoco's net income and cash flow for a number of years.     John Ashmun, chairman of Wainoco, said ""as a result of this recapitalization, Wainoco will be in a strong financial position.     ""Our net income and cash flow will benefit from lower interest expense, lower Canadian taxes, and the considerable savings achieved over the past few years from cost reductions,"" he said.     Ashmun said the company will be able to ""utilize enhanced cash flow to develop its large resource base and explore for additional reserves at a time when exploration and development costs are low and opportunities abound rather than using a disproportiaonate share of cash flow for debt service.""

960," COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY     By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters     LONDON, March 24 - The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.     ""Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday,"" a consumer delegate said. ""The atmosphere is excellent.""     Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday.     A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a ""very interesting stage of negotiations,"" delegates said.     The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.     Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow.     Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said.     The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said.     The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council.     Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said.     The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added.     One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is ""transparency,"" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said.     After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said.      Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said.     The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed.      Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.

962," MEXICO SEES COMPROMISE ON IADB REFORMS     MIAMI, March 24 - There is a good chance that the United States and Latin America will agree reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks yesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.     ""This is a complex issue, but I am very optimistic on an agreement, he told reporters during the IADB's annual meeting here.     The U.S., which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank, has proposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct, a move strongly opposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct.     Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the issue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank interim meetings next month in Washington.     He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America's position during talks yesterday with the so-called ""A"" countries - Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer a net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a substantial capital increase.     Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of funds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90, plus 2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment.     But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a nine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms were agreed, a position described today by Nicaragua's Central Bank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic.     Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed ""flexibility in being prepared to accommodate different proposals"" and promised to look into alternatives.     He said an alternative now being looked at was for new procedures for delaying IADB loan approval, to satisfy U.S. concern that lending is currently too lax, rather than a change in the basic voting structure.     There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it would need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a year, after which a second review would require a 40 pct blocking vote.

In common with Venezuela, he expressed reservations on the conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington's proposals for increased IADB sectoral lending, but welcomed a bigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy.

963," PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986      CARACAS, March 24 - The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.     Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion.     Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact on Venezuela.""     PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products.     The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.     The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations.     Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.     Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.      Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.     Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year.     Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years.     The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987.     During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500.     Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained.     ""It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand,"" he said.     Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.     Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States.     The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices.     Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The transaction is expected to be completed by September 30.     CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed, it said.     The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business.     The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November, CPC said.     Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was  part of the restructuring.     As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual report.     In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs.     CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt, including that incurred under the share buyback.     In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.     The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of CPC's then outstanding stock.     In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8 mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.

979," NEW S.AFRICA ACCORD WITH BANKS BROUGHT COMPROMISE     By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters     LONDON, March 24 - A new agreement covering the repayment of part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromise between that country and its commercial bank creditors following several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations, senior banking sources said.     In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed the agreement a ""good deal"" for both South Africa and the banks.     But as one senior banker noted, ""It is probably the best we could hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the South Africans) didn't want to pay.""     The new agreement will extend for three years the standstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985 and which was due to expire on June 30.     Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will receive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the arrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.     It also will require the repayment over the life of the standstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over six month invervals and depending on the maturity of the various debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion dlrs.     Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the 14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers had argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the country's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.     Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even larger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had been speculation that the standstill would be extended for three years, many did not believe that a long term pact would be acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line in the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid policies.     The agreement reached today differs very little from the one reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include one moderation of an option contained in that pact which introduces yet another ""catchphrase"" into the jargon for reschedulings.     The new agreement contains an ""exit vehicle"" under which banks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the previous agreement banks were only given options for three year loans.     While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it could offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than half their investment over the next seven years.     To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower looking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate individually the interest rates to be charged.     The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan would be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a repayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of face value by year seven, one banker said.     Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and economic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the option it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers. They noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is an active borrower in this area of the market.     Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief debt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill Coordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on the commercial bank technical committee.     The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the country's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation covering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.     Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's apartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with Fritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank, acting as mediator.     Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not involved himself in the negotiations since last year, the bankers said.     Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal to Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time the procedure will be less structured and will be up to the individual banks as to how they wish to handle it.     Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the South Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement on the repayments took many in the financial community by surprise.     A review of South Africa's economy by the technical committee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February while the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some time this month or next month.     However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity which surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings were kept secret.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

981," U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS     WASHINGTON, March 24 - The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security.     The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.     The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries.     Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.     ""This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,"" the Washington Democrat said.     The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls.     Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments.     It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

989," SOUTH AFRICA, CREDITOR BANKS AGREE ON DEBT PLAN     PRETORIA, March 24 - South Africa will repay 13 pct of its frozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in London, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.     He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.     ""These arrangements confirm South Africa's continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,"" du Plessis told a news conference.     Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was ""substantially a continuation"" of the arrangement ending in June and calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of over 23 billion dlrs.     Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a ""good deal"" both for South Africa and the banks.     Speaking at the same news conference, de Kock said the three-year length of the agreement was of ""enormous significance"" to South Africa.     He said South Africa had negotiated from a ""position of basic economic financial strength.""     ""We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever heard of,"" de Kock said.     Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months, and a continued current account surplus ""will be sufficient"" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.     Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the South African economy and country as a whole.     He attributed this to ""restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest.""     South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2,400 lives in the past three years.     Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors.     He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again ""taking a more realistic view"" of South Africa. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.

1036," U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR     LONDON, March 17 - Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said.     Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate.     The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around 75 pct in 1986.     He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to cheaper imports from abroad.     ""Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"" Wagner said. ""In the long term we expect annual production to decline steadily.""     The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by 0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes from 3.23 mln, he said.

1051," CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM     By Simon Haydon, Reuters     HELSINKI, March 17 - Conservative gains in Finnish general elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets, though there will not be a radical economic restructuring, conservative officials and economic analysts said.     The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.     International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: ""we are willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible.""     Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its period of government between 1983 and 1987.     They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to other European conservative movements and had, for example, shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.     Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.    The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.     Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.     The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno- Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.     Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the election news, with little movement in the markka or on the Helsinki stock exchange.     Securities analysts said the market would respond positively if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would hang on to power.     The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation governing the stock market to prevent ""casino-style behaviour.""     He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment of an internal market between the Nordic countries.      International capital markets were becoming more and more important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the development of Finland's capial markets.    He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA).     Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new government will probably not be established before the start of April.     Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56 seats.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France during the interview.     An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of Exxon's opertations were under constant review.     Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.     Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation, its future profits there should be good.     ""Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior earnings,"" Mlotok said.

""On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,"" said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. ""This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal.""     The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.     The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.     Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted.     However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would ""involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is.""     Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.     Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business.     The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January.     President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted.     Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.     Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1085," LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE     LONDON, March 17 - Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement.     Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).     To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said.     The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.     Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability.     This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said.     This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said.     In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated.     The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.     These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation.     Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.     Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.     He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.     Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said.     Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.     He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.     This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.     He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.

Marc Mathieu of <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications> SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT <T.N.> and the NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>.     The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi <MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.    Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20 pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.     The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to close discussions within the government due to legal queries over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry official said.     Although bought by French citizens they are managed by foreign banks <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and <Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled by Algemene Bank Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.     CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln francs by private tender.     Five groups are bidding for the company and the government has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.     APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but declined to give details or say how an increase would affect foreign stakes in CGCT.     In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.     A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to French standards.     The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction of the French government privatisation laws which reopened bidding among a wider range of applicants.

1090," ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE     LONDON, March 17 - British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.     The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward.     Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said.     Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.     ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,"" he said.     Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now.     Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.     ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said.     Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. ""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said.     National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.     Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented.  But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said.     Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.     U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets.     But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

1098," OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS     PARIS, March 17 - The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called ""mixed credits,"" the OECD said.     The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations.     Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said.     Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year.     The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.

1107," DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE, BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS     LONDON, March 17 - The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said.     Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies ""can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective.""     He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald ""an era of greater exchange rate stability.""     The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level.     ""At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen,"" Gleske said.     He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.     But ""a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value,"" he said.    In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said.     First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses.     Second, in the United States, it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said.     Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, ""both within countries and between them.""     For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.     If target zones were established, this would put ""pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities,"" he said.     Gleske added, ""targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities.""     Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained.     These chances ""seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.""     Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned ""that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot."" He said this ""would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible.""     Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Bayer's shares fell 13 marks to close at 292 in Frankfurt today.

1111," PLAYBOY <PLA> HAS NO RESTRUCTURING PLANS     CHICAGO, March 17 - Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no plans to restructure or to take the company private.     Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more than 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his stock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said.      Articles in two weekly business publications have said Playboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial analysts see as its undervalued asset base.     Radomski said there were no corporate developments to account for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but that there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.     Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover of about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has traded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.     The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark Boyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs a share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about 130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real estate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and its excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs, according to Business Week.     According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion and artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share, the Forbes Magazine article said.     According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most recognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.     Radomski, noting that the articles were written without contact with Playboy, said that ""from time to time people do speculate about the company.""     She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in the ""last day or so"" for a reaction to the articles.     American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes ""anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged buyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are nil."" Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the company private, he said.     But ""shareholders who held the stock prior to all the publicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money,"" he said.     Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value of the company is likely to exceed the current price of the stock. ""But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take management at their word,"" he said.     While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a drain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees potential. ""They do have a management plan for the cable operation and the company as a whole,"" he said. ""Were this plan to, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for earnings is significant,"" he said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy.  reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.

The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said.     The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.     Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.     The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said.     After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.

They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate.     The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year.     The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.     Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself.     The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.     Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements ""is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together.""

1142," U.K. BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET     By Norma Cohen, Reuters     LONDON, March 17 - Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.     Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely sharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose about two points on the day.     ""This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,"" Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.     Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the budget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point tomorrow.     Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection of supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held to 4.0 billion stg.     By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion stg.     The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further, analysts said.     ""The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically expected,"" Bell said. Most market expectations called for the Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.     S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said that overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in total new issue volume.     Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap issues.     The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full price does not have to be paid until the start of the new fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current year's fund raising.     But the Bank of England will also be constrained from issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try out a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new stock.     The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail Price Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to be raised in the form of traditional stock.     Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line with most market expectations, although some operators had expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.     The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut, Shepherd said, because ""If it was more than two pct, they would have become concerned about the economy heating up again.""     Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the ruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut can be offered at budget time next year.     Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam on the political implications of the budget which suggests an early election.     ""All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the middle of May,"" Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. ""This makes a June election very likely.""     Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.     At that rate, they would have been of little use for a political party expecting to call an election in June.     Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.     ""This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour party to attack,"" Shepherd said.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.     Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.     Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April, it said.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.     Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by late April.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India, reversing February's below-normal trend.     Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas, it said.     In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao.     Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.     In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java, it said.

Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia.     Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands, it said.

1155," ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS     By Simon Cox, Reuters     LONDON, March 17 - Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.     A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.     ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""     Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.     Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.     As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment"" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct.     The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.     Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow.     ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.     The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.     Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.     ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"" he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation.     The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said     Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation.     Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front.     He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness.     Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.     Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg.     But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988.     Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.     But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it.     James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""     Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.     Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1156," TAFT <TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL     By Patti Domm     New York, March 17 - Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.     However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover.     ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager.     Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.     Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share.     The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company.     ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager.     Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites.     Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co, its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring.     Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft, which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50 years ago, has about 12 pct.     Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.     ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager, but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s.     Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.     Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout.     ""Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved,"" he said, adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.     He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1157," BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP     PARIS, March 17 - The Bank of France expects a continued revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.     The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall in January, while construction and civil engineering experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the next few months.     Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.     Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception of the agro-food industry, improved substantially.     In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last months.     Production rose in all sectors except agricultural machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship construction, where it declined.     The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in activity in February, with both domestic and export orders rising.     In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite a fall in the household goods sector and stability in pharmaceuticals.     Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped by a strong growth in construction materials.     But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over the past two months.

He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day.     The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.     Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce.     He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.     Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy.     He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day.

The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy.     The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.""     But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases.     ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,"" Al-Wattari said.     ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.     Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices.     The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added.     He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.     But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation,"" he said.     Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.     Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.     Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

1189," BUDGET SEEN PAVING WAY FOR EARLY U.K. ELECTION     By Sten Stovall, Reuters     LONDON, March 17 - The budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as being politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's standing with both voters and financial markets.     The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the standard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.     Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a fall in domestic interest rates and an early election.     Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget ""is not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible.""     Lawson told journalists later that it was ""a budget built on success, for success.""     But opposition MPs did not agree .     David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said ""this was a strangely deceptive budget.     The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty.""     Steel said ""the cunning thing in this seductive budget is that all the good things will come in the pre-election period - the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the lower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes and petrol.""     David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping, said ""this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it has failed in its objective. It has given money to the ""haves"" as opposed to the ""have-nots.""     Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it ""a bribes budget.""     Kinnock said the budget ""had little to do with the general good, and everything to do with the general election.""     Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said ""the Tories should have used available resources to invest in industry, in health and in education.""     He added that ""we know that whoever is elected (to power in the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts.""     But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for use in cutting taxes or raising public spending.     Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the government would be forced to call an election by a deteriorating economy.     In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said that ""the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and strong, and unemployment is falling.""     He said that ""these are the fruits of the government's determination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to our policies of sound money and free markets.""     Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to plump for an early election.     Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would have on election timing, he replied ""I think we will hold the election either late or early. I must confess I am rather relaxed about it all.     ""There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.     But he added that ""if the Prime Minister decides to go for an early election, it will bring to an end all this rather ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is something to be said for that.""     Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said ""This budget will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI wanted.""     ""We have always said we would judge the budget on how it affects the cost of borrowing.

Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committee was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it would pass the full House and this would require Republican votes.     ""Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless the president signs on,"" the Illinois Democrat said in remarks for delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.     Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax intact.     The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in 1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct next year.     In addition, he said ""they don't have the energy or appetite to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"" which he also opposes. ""The real question is where the Republicans will be when the tough vote comes,"" he said.     Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or trade bill this year.     He added that no extension or expansion of the research and development tax credit for business is expected since it would cost billions of dollars.     And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker as Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White House will ultimately back a tax increase this year. ""There are strong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president down the slippery slope of moderation,"" he said.   Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1196," U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH     By Claire Miller, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 17 - Surprisingly strong U.S. housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth, economists said.     Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.     U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986.     The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.     ""February's weather is usually more adverse for home building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures inflate the statistics.     Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month. But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.     ""Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let's do it now',"" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much of the financing for home building.     But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and  some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.     He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.     As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1.     Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.     ""Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers to start waving ""four pct GNP banners"" for the first quarter. Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.     But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not convinced that growth will pick up in future.     ""The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on now, not all of which is intentional,"" he said. For example, U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks, produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.     Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second, he said.     ""If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"" agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects.     Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.     ""At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the second,"" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

1200," U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88     LONDON, March 17 - The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86.     The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.     The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said.     The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag.     The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year.     Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.     Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.     Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot.     Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.     Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year.     The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year.     A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury said.

Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.     Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of 729,500 shares.     Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An analyst familiar with the two mines said ""the properties, together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share for Reynolds.""     The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise in the stock today was likely the result of ""U.S. investors that were not completely cognizant of the size or the importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia.""     Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine. Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.     The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.     Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.

In a proxy statement, the company said shareholders are to vote on the reorganization, which would result in Alcan's wholly-owned Aluminum Co of Canada Ltd unit replacing Alcan Aluminium as the group's parent company, at the April 23 annual meeting. The new company will keep the Alcan Aluminium Ltd name.     Alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the additional shares.     The company has said it is undertaking the reorganization mainly to streamline management and give Alcan a stronger and more stable financing base by making the new Alcan a major operating company as well as a holding and management company.     ""In an increasingly global capital market, this new structure should also provide for greater flexibility in financing the Alcan group,"" the company said.     Alcan's current only outstanding securities are common shares while the new company would have outstanding securities of common, preferred and preference shares, and its debt.     Each shareholder would automatically become a shareholder in the new company without exchanging share certificates.

The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in 1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebec utility said hearings are normally held on major contracts up to two years after the deal is signed.     Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billion dlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convince the board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.     Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have said they are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and New Brunswick utilities said they are objecting because Hydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going to the New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is also concerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export markets.     Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several provinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a power agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec utility's export contracts.     Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes to contracts in the past but has always left the agreements essentially intact.     He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether it believed the board would call for substantial changes to the agreement with New England.     He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last two or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.     Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export contracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed amounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1208," U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM     WASHINGTON, March 17 - The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant.     The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.     Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.     USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs.     The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received.     To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay.     USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.     The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding.     In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall.     Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.     The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance.     USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings.     USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs.     USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs.     In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.     But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The group includes senior management of Service America but no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.     The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America, it said.     Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary.     The company said the group's review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or, if made, accepted.     Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of 1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.     He declined to identify the Service America officials in the acquisition group.     On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so.

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade).      He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies.     Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct.     Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.     Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange.     Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern state of  arequipa.     Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies.

1250," NO POLICY FOR OR AGAINST CERTIFICATES -- OMB     WASHINGTON, March 17 - The U.S. Office of Management and Budget does not have a policy position one way or another on whether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate program should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.     Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's annual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural branch, said instead of an across the board policy for or against certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work very closely with USDA in determining how many certificates should be sent out in each government farm payment.     ""Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and do increase budget exposure,"" Landis said.     But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous beneficial impacts.     These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the government storage and handling costs.     The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of the pik and roll marketing strategy.     In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan rate.     However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the program.     ""OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the market, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh the added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is good,"" an OMB official told Reuters.     Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate worth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for wheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for soybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit of about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.     But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest that an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to the market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for every dlr released in certificates.     OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto the market could cause prices to drop too low and government costs to increase too much.     But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of certificates would be excessive.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1258," U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES     Washington, March 16 - From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987.     These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.     Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said.     The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise.     The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said.     The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.     During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.     The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs.     In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said.     Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1261," FAVOURABLE TAX TREATMENT GONE ON CERTAIN UK LOANS     LONDON, March 17 - An Inland Revenue ruling accompanying today's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment on certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a ""nightmare"" of practical application, banking sources said.     This is because banks will only be able to offset the tax credit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they receive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific loan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks profits as a whole.     For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a nightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.     Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change are those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin America. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were involved expect to suggest it was a ""sizable number.""     In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made on or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest arising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the measures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.     Government sources noted that the existing treatment of withholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce interest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue to the U.K. Treasury.     The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the subsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and bring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas competitors.     The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the Treausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over time from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.     But while compliance with the new measures could necessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return to the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.     They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans contains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the tax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent the loans would and could be changed.     Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland Revenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these loans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a minimum.

His resignation was accepted during a meeting with  President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.     No official reasons for the resignation were immediately available, but sources close to the government said Sayad had pressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp government spending cuts to combat inflation.     Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro accepted the proposals, the sources said.     Sayad was one of the architects of last year's ""Plano Cruzado"" program, which froze prices, ended widespread indexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzado currency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pct annual inflation rate.     After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan was unable to withstand the inflationary pressures of booming consumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first two months of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.     A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus caused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension of interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial debt.     Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new measures to correct the economy would be announced within a month, although he gave no further details.     Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said  Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.

Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union.     Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country.     ""That very well may be the case,"" said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.     Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.     ""I'd be delighted to deliver the message,"" Kay replied.

However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled that TransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit against Coastal that alleges the Houston based gas company is attempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texas gas reserve and pipeline system.     Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans to maintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcy reorganization proceedings that began in 1983.     After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican, said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking 2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.     Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted to replace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan paying secured creditors in full with a plan of its own.     ""They're not going to pay any money under their plan, they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profit to the creditors,"" Nabors said.     He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrs annually for seven years.     TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs in debts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on the dollar to unsecured creditors.      A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecured creditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.     Transamerican said it is the second largest producer of natural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.

""He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the Soviet Union,"" said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.     Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be identified, said Lyng was ""unresponsive"" to the group's request.

A grain industry representative said some participants were ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.     ""There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"" this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.

1327," U.S. OTC MARKET PROPOSES ONE-SHARE, ONE-VOTE     By Judith Crosson, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 17 - The National Association of Securities Dealers said all stock exchanges should require that listed companies adopt a ""one-share, one-vote"" rule, but with a few exceptions.     In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD President Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to be the first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certain exceptions.     ""Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. If a voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then the commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,"" the NASD said.     An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the OTC offered only one class of stock.     The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a uniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal voting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.     The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not have voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled out to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from turning voting shares into non-voting shares, without shareholder approval, Parrillo said.     ""A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been construed by some to be an abusive practice involving the use of stock with other than full voting rights,"" the association said in the statement.     Exceptions would include:     -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts connected with the company's capital structure are clearly spelled out in the prospectus.     -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied by detailed proxy material.     The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of stock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority of independent directors on the board approve the move. The NYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual classes to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.     The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual class shares where those with superior voting rights are not resalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect prevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs,"" the paper quoted the official as saying.     ""Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies,"" said the official, who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> takeover bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.     The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.     Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology.     The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.     ""Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest,"" Baldrige was quoted as saying.

1337," YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN'S FAVOURITE HORROR     By Steven Brull, Reuters     TOKYO, March 18 - ""Endaka,"" the strong yen, has usurped ""Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster"" as Japan's favourite horror story.     The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon, the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month.     But ""endaka,"" like many Japanese products, is for foreign consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.     ""It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to the cost of living,"" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo.     Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by ""chatting"" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.     She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day.     ""For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso soup, rice and tea,"" although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner.     No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.     The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.     ""You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down. It's not reasonable,"" said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.     Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day.     While the businessmen have little choice but to come here, many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.     The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates ""endaka"" caused an 11.5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.     Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by curtailing shopping, it said.     To help combat ""endaka"" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet, ""Economical Travel in Japan.""     It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public baths while getting a ""revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives.""     Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.     For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated, berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese ""flop house.""     Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work. ""Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours.""     Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. ""I had to spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat,"" he said.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share.     The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and sequestered by the government.     The block is split between class A and class B stock.     SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N. Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano, del Rosario said.     The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.     Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers.     He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.     President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares.     Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government.

""We have given permission for a small amount of imports to prevent a shortage during Ramadan,"" he said.

Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and have large meals after sunset.     Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of 1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures, against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.

1345," ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS     By JEFF STEARNS, REUTERS     TOKYO, March 18 - More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.     Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses.     In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers.     Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd <DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said.     Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.     Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.     ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" a takeover specialist at one trading company said.     Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.     But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said.     Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports.     Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity.     ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said a banking industry source.     So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.     While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.     Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.     Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.     A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's <DIAC.T> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added.     Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses.     Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This is a healthy progression.""     However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.     ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.""     A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.""     But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said.     Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,"" one takeover specialist said.     Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.     But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

1351," THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT     By Vithoon Amorn, Reuters     BANGKOK, March 18 - Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said.     They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market.     Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said.     Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said.     Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.     Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.     Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits.     Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.     The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.     Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.     Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital.     If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.     Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

1356," GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON     By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters     TOKYO, March 18 - Global trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.     ""Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures,"" said Katsuyuki Okayasu, general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.     ""But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market,"" said Tetsuya Dezuka, deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in London.     Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there, dealers said.     Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.     An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous 12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind.     LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last December.     But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers said.     Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.     ""Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"" Dezuka said.     The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's growth, dealers said.     Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year, securities managers said.     The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract, they said.     The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country.     Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April.     CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market.     ""Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,"" said Koki Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's bond administration division.     Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters.     Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September, or June and December from April 1, matching futures delivery months.     The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities managers said.     LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen, bond managers said.     These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates, they said.     Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987.

Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market.     Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today, possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg.     Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,1
1359," FRN TRADING SEEN RETURNING TO MORE NORMAL PATTERNS     LONDON, March 18 - Conditions on the floating rate note market appeared to be returning gradually to normal today with prices static to a little better generally, dealers said.     The market was showing limited signs of recovery from the collapse in trading last night and the calmer tone was reinforced this morning as the first significant retail orders for some time emerged, one senior FRN trader noted.     In fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmer with euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullish trend and activity in dollar straight and ECU-denominated bonds also picking up slowly.     Although a handful of FRN market makers were expected to remain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted a tangible return of retail interest from the Far East, lured back by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.     ""We are seeing from Singapore, and from Japan clients keen to use up their quotas for purchase of particular instruments before the end of the fiscal year,"" the senior trader added.     Any investors not buying to their full limit would run the risk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.     However, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was in demand with U.S. Bank sector paper largely ignored.     Prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by an average of 10 basis points in early trading but FRN dealers cautioned that the mood was still nervous.     ""If prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is more than well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again,"" commented another FRN market source at a large Japanese house.     The other sector commanding market attention today was eurosterling, which soared in line with U.K. Government bonds.     Both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound and renewed buying by U.K. Institutions following Chancellor of the Exchequer's Nigel Lawson's well-received budget yesterday.     ""This was definitely a budget for lower sterling interest rates,"" said a sterling analyst at a U.K. Merchant bank.     ""It has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looks good to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tap the eurosterling markets now,"" he added.     News that next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement will be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0 billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets. The government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged markets will create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upward pressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.     This could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, as long as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts -- often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.     Bullish predictions on the U.K.'s general economic health were also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.     Market sources said attention would now switch to monitoring the fortunes of the ruling Conservative party in opinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.     Although several new sterling deals are expected, in early trading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30 mln convertible deal for British Land Co Plc.     Other new deals this morning reflected the recent primary market trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issues although the currency sectors were busy.     Hot on the heels of yesterday's two Canadian dollar issues was a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for Chrysler Credit Canada, guaranteed by Chrysler Finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/2 pct.     A 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for Associates Corp of North America paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992. A similar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a Scandinavian borrower. Details were not immediately available.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's price which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.     The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings, which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a result of the takeover of <AE Plc>.     The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln stg from 39.6 mln previously.     It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of some 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings of some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end had risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The rights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further development through investment and acquisition.     But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after a long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened the group's position in the automotive components and engineering materials sectors.     In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of 27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months previously.    As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until December 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986 results.     Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward to taking advantage of the opportunities available.    1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from Zimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local currency against the dollar.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.     Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.     The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.     The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.     The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.     Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.     Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.     Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.

1387," DEUTSCHE BABCOCK RIGHTS ISSUE PRICED AT 165 MARKS     OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 18 - Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a two-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.     The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to April eight, it added.     Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a close of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged three mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last week that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company. These shares will be placed with institutional investors.     The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks, which share market analysts said was likely be used partly to finance expansion, especially in environment technology.     However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major Frankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to bring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered heavy losses in the early 1980s.     This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these losses, which were due to problems linked with three major contracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net loss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.     Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its results in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose from the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.     The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the pricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was unfortunate.     The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in VEBA AG <VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely 2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with a large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener insurance group.     The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has generally put pressure on West German stocks which have also suffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.     Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with Iran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since 1975.     When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the market took the news calmly. Analysts said today the combination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not have a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct placement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors both in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee for a Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS.     He said, ""One failing of the EMS is important countries, like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should give up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations.""     EMS member Belgium has both a ""financial"" and a ""commercial"" franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct against other member currencies, compared with a permitted fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.     According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the finance minister also urged greater convergence of economic and financial policies among European countries.     He added that monetary stability should be a priority for European countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, he said it was wrong to presume that a ""permanent devaluation"" was the answer to economic problems.     Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the dollar in 1985. ""But an overshooting in the other direction now brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And other countries whose currencies have declined,"" he added.     He said such a development could also produce further burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement last month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he said.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1394," ZAIRE AND IMF IN ECONOMIC RESCUE TALKS     By Jean-Loup Fievet, Reuters     KINSHASA, March 18 - Talks are underway between financially troubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed at rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in sub-Saharan Africa.     Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a compromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks enabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of cash.     For its part the government is expected to increase budgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract foreign investors, the sources said.     ""Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled out in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial political and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors are bound to come to terms soon,"" a Western diplomat told Reuters.     ""The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF assistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's strategic minerals fall into communist hands,"" the diplomat said.     Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it would limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to 10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.     The government also announced an end to the floating exchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed parity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic adjustments.     Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export revenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the copper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and often extravagant investment projects.     Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth largest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for two-thirds of its export earnings.     ""A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing everything for the sake of servicing its external debt,"" President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he announced his government's decision.     As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that ""one does not feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one toward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire,"" he told diplomats.     Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed austerity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital without receiving appropriate financing from abroad.     Economists said that since the large devaluation of the zaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net outflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.     Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few years reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross National Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the world, banking sources said.     Mobutu accused the IMF of ""strangling"" his country at an October meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people could not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.     Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the IMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said, failed to materialise last year,     - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and boosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,     - substantial, additional financial help from the country's traditional donors.     In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at curbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed spending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western creditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.     As a result, the overall economic and financial situation improved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from 100 pct in 1983.     But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living standards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread discontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.     Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between 20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months, despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced last May.     The World Bank has released in the last two months half of a previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent 27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport system.     Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading partner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to ease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts for industry.     A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the way for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting of the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.

1395," JAPAN TO ADOPT ITS LARGEST-EVER PROVISIONAL BUDGET     By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters     TOKYO, March 18 - A parliamentary boycott by opposition members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever provisional budget, finance ministry officials said.     The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040 billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.     An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year ending March 31.     The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliament on March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls for economic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by the yen's sharp rise, officials said.     It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for public works, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for such works in the full budget. Traditionally, a provisional budget covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.     The government also expects the budget to meet pressure from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic demand, they said.     The budget includes expenditures for a program to create 300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officials said.     They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming as possible.     Economists said confidence of opposition members in their campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could lead to even further delays in passing the full budget.     The result may be that the government will have to delay its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in April, economists said.     That package is expected to include a plan to carry out more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first half of the fiscal year, a government official said.     Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April because of the sales tax confrontation. Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan to prepare for the economic summit of seven major industrial democracies in June, they added.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1399," LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT     By Sten Stovall, Reuters     LONDON, March 18 - Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct.     However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly.     He told a briefing of economic journalists that ""I don't think we should rush anything."" Lawson stressed the themes of ""gradualism and steadiness"" as economic policy.     Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP.     Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were ""perfectly consistent"" with monetary conditions now in Britain.     He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was ""safely inside"" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.     Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that ""it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election.""     He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.     Although Lawson denounced what he said was ""the current wave of election fever"" in Britain, he added:  ""It is more likely that there will be an election this year"" than not.     He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. ""Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term,"" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said.     The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.     The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 ""was the right balance, economically and politically,"" he said.     Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.     But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate.     Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.     Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that ""they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy."" Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.     But ""there may be interest rate consequences"" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added.     Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain.     He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries.     Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.     First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.     He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.      Thirdly, he said ""we do not have as long a track record of low inflation"" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.     Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo.

1405," NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88     WELLINGTON, March 18 - New Zealand's inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.     The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December.     Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.     The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.     The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to change, it said.     Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986, it said.     ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls away,"" the NZIER said.     Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.     Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.     The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.     ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.""     The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86.     The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86.     This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.     ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said.

GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at 90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.     In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.     General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.     It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp shares.     General Partners said it would set up voting trust arrangements pending review of its long-form application for FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's broadcasting subsidiary.     The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for minority shareholders to elect directors.     General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.     GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.     Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire <Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private for 1.66 billion dlrs.     GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign payments and political contributions.     GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs. An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.     For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.     A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1410," FRANCE PROTESTS OVER CANADA'S FISHING BAN     PARIS, March 18 - France today protested over Canada's decision to declare its ports off limits to French fishing vessels and bar further fishing by France off Newfoundland.     A foreign ministry statement described yesterday's decision by Canada as ""unjustified and contrary to international law and commitments made by Canada,"" and called on Ottawa authorities to reexamin their position.     Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday said that any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, off the south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.     ""The French government strongly protests against the closing of Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against the fishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank,"" the ministry statement added.     The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latest episode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have a negative effect on fishing negotiations currently held between Ottawa and Paris.     Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their 6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.     In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishing accord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing France to increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.     Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to refer differences over a maritime boundary zone near the French islands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to international arbitration.

1425," BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE     By Franz-Josef Ebel, Reuters     FRANKFURT, March 18 - The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.     ""There is no need for action,"" Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.     Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.     One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.     Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.     But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit.     Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates.     Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.     Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.     Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year.     ""The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing,"" one economist said.     He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.     This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.     These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.     Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.     Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.     Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.     The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks.     Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.     One dealer said, ""If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.""     Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.  REUTER ",0,0,1,0,0,0,1

That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the fourth quarter of 1985.     The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of 1986 over 1985.

The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only one private company should enter the market.

Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.     He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct .

Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.     Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.     However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987.     The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said.     Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.     Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output.     The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.     In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said.     However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

1452," WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES     FRANKFURT, March 18 - West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period.     A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F> and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.     The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks.     A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said.     But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said.     He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate.     The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct.     Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern, that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.     Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making, aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding.

In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed 250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for  a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, a unit of American Express Co <AXP>.

He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or whether it would issue a statement later today.     In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment.     The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes over license renewals at several of its television stations.

The shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.     The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo.

In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.

Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges.     Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been ""one of the most traumatic in our history,"" but that clients and staff had been supportive.     ""I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.""     Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.     Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was ""within reasonable touch of the budget.""     Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months.     He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.     Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday's 375p.  REUTER... ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1471," ENVOY SEES BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR PHILIPPINES     By PHILLIP MELCHIOR, REUTERS     MANILA, March 18 - The Philippines is poised for several years of stability and economic growth but faces major long-term problems from its rapidly increasing population, U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth told Reuters in an interview.     ""Medium-term out to the 1990s I am increasingly optimistic about this country,"" he said. ""But if you look beyond that... You are jumping off the edge into the unknown.""     Bosworth, who retires on April 2 after almost four years as U.S. Ambassador, forecast a real per capita increase in disposable income of more than four pct in 1987.     The Philippines has not seen such an increase this decade.     He said there were reasons to believe the Philippines could out-perform the world economy by enough to continue to generate increases in per capita income in the medium term.     ""There is nothing big and dramatic yet and maybe big and dramatic won't ever happen. But I think foreign investors are now no longer saying let's wait and see how the political side turns out,"" he said.     Bosworth said much hope had been placed on the land reform program promised by President Corazon Aquino, but he warned it was not a complete cure for the country's ills.     He said even the redistribution of land to tenant farmers would not be a substitute for the generation of new employment in the countryside.""There is no way even in 1987 that this country can provide employment growth in farming. Certainly it is not going to be able to do so in the future,"" he added.     ""This has to be off-farm employment,"" he declared.     Bosworth said the population problem produced major uncertainties for the future of the country. He said that more than 60 pct of today's 50 mln people are said to live below the poverty line and official predictions suggest the population will double within the next three decades.     The ambassador said he believed population statistics to be understated.     Bosworth said he expected current high domestic liquidity to be drawn down during the next six months with some corresponding upward pressure on interest rates, now at about nine pct.     He said his predictions only assumed the Aquino government did not make any big mistakes. They did not assume any great transformation of the Philippine system.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1472," SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L <AG>     WASHINGTON, March 18 - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement action against Allegheny International Inc, the Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.     Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.     ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.     ""The company is cooperating in the commission's investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.     In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked for information about company executive compensation and benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.     It also has asked for information on acquisitions and divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other internal controls,"" Allegheny said.    The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.     The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions.     The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements.     The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors.     Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price.     Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges.     The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.     In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March 13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

1480," VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986     MUNICH, March 18 - Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year.     Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.     He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels.     Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year.     Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits.     Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.     Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged ""sudden acceleration"" of some of its Audi 5000 models.     As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year.     Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987.     Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.     Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985.     Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000.     Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000.     Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees.     At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.

1491," CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL     By Jerry Bieszk, Reuter     CHICAGO, March 18 - Most of the cattle now being placed on U.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.     The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements reported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock analysts said.     After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in seven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a 15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.     Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally placed on feed.     Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.     The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots, helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from February, 1986.     University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes said, ""The probabilities are high that in order to place that many cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to lighter-weight cattle.     The only statistics available are from some terminal markets which represent only a small percentage of the total cattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs in February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.     Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed, Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.     If the average weight is down, and there is no price weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct.     Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly LBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly because of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle prices.     Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.     Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.     Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his area benefited from a dry, mild winter.     To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.

""I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point,"" said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat.

The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200 tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to 14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850 tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.     The study noted that the effects of last year's lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago.     However, the study said that primary production, likely to reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in 1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.     Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru.     Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1530," U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS     By Geert Linnebank, Reuters     LONDON, March 18 - Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.     They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.     Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg.     Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.     Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.     But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.     Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.     ""Today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. ""The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.""     Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time.     The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term.     Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.     ""The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,"" said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. ""But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long.""     Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.     Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said ""There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.""     Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate.     Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.     Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets.     With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said ""Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.""

1540," ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY     By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters     TOKYO, March 18 - Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.     The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.     The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.     The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.     They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.     Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.     The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said.     A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said.     Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.     This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.     The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.     The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989.     Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping.     However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said.     Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.     The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said.     In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.     ""World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,"" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.     The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

A company spokesman said the company will file an investigational new drug application by the end of the month, requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.     Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS virus.     Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.     The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity against AIDS.

The refinery is run by Suralco, jointly owned by the U.S. Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.     Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the Billiton spokesman added.     The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when rebels cut the main power line.     Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa's mine at Moengo in the east of the country.     Billiton's mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the Billiton spokesman said.

This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10 mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year, company officials told a press briefing.     Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs, according to the annual report released at the briefing.     In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium and long term debt obligations.     Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs.

The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew 20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and production level of 382,000,000 ounces.     However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000 ounces at the end of 1986, it said.     The review noted that world industrial consumption has been on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.     Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985, with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S. coins, including the American Eagle.

1557," SPANISH POWER COMPANY FECSA MAY SUSPEND PAYMENTS     By Jules Stewart, Reuters     MADRID, March 18 - Spain's financially troubled power company <Fuerzas Electricas de Cataluna S.A.> (FECSA) may suspend payments if it fails to reach agreement with creditors on renegotiating its 594 billion peseta debt, a company official said.     ""We would only take this step in the event of a lack of co-operation on the part of our creditors,"" FECSA assistant general manager Jose Zaforteza told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""It is unlikely they will refuse to renegotiate.""     He said creditors would obtain a better deal by negotiating than under a suspension of payments.     FECSA is scheduled to begin formal talks with its creditors on April 6, and foreign banks holding some 184 billion pesetas of debt said they were angered over what they called a lack of information on the company's situation.     The spokesman for one U.S. Bank creditor said in reply to inquiries ""It has been two months since we first detected signs of serious trouble at FECSA, and we still have no idea of how the company plans to restructure its finances.""     The spokesman said no foreign bankers had been notified when FECSA yesterday, in an action unrelated to a possible total payments suspension, suspended payment on its debt principal.     FECSA's Zaforteza said, however, that telexes had been sent to creditors notifying them of the move, which he said was unavoidable.     He said the decision did not affect payment of interest on loans and debentures. FECSA faces repayment of 60 billion pesetas in interest and 30 billion on principal this year.     The U.S. Bank spokesman said foreign banks ""were now more in the dark"" than ever.     FECSA called for renegotiating its debt when the Madrid stock exchange on February 6 suspended trading in its shares, a move which officials said was meant to protect shareholders.     Zaforteza said the company will ask its creditors to switch old debt to new loans at lower interest rates, postpone interest payments and possibly convert some debt into shares.     Foreign bankers said they assumed the government was involved in the control and management of the electricity sector.     They added that lending policy toward the industry could be affected if the banks lost money in FECSA.     Foreign banking sources said they considered likely a fresh postponement of a 10 billion peseta Chase Manhattan Bank <CMB.N> led syndicated loan to power company <Hidrolectrica de Cataluna S.A.> (Hidruna).     The facility was scheduled to be signed in mid-February but was postponed when the bourse suspended FECSA's shares.

Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules, and although the impact will not be material in the short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report said.     The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.     Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in 1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it said.     Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place, the report said.     This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.     In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in the form of common stock.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1587," U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING     By Andrew Stern, Reuters     CHICAGO, March 18 - Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.     Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.     By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed.     If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis.     ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest.     ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market.     The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage.     Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain.     With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.     A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said.     Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.     The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said.     ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said.     But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1592," GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST     WEST BERLIN, March 18 - The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.     The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.     The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.      The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct.     Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.     In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak.     DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.     It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.     Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand, it said.     In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year.     However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986, it said.

1599," UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY     WASHINGTON, March 18 - U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.     The controversial study, which has not yet been released by the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD sources in Paris said last month.     Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday, suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.     The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.     The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for the years 1979 through 1981.     Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community would want ""credit"" in the negotiations for recent actions taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.     Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.     An Australian trade official said Canberra has ""grave technical reservations"" about the use of the PSE calculations. U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect recent changes in farm programs worldwide.

1602," FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT     PARIS, March 18 - The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.     The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program.     Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show.     The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market.     Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers.     ""Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,"" an aide to Seguin said.     The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.     He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.     Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.     The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.     Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.      Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour.      Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988.     The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network.    The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry.     The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.

He said Sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs at the end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.     Omer said it ""will be difficult, if not impossible"" for Sudan to pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interest payments over the next five years.     He said Sudan had reached agreement with the Soviet Union and its East European allies to service half of its debts to them in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.     Western diplomatic and official sources in Khartoum say 32 pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is to the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc and Arab countries.     Sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which last year declared it ineligible for fresh loans.     The sources said Sudan, hit by a slump in export earnings and remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.     Sudan, its Treasury depleted by nearly four years of civil war in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85 drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds this fiscal year.     Diplomatic and official sources said Sudan was now only servicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banning them from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.     They said these included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank and its soft loan affiliate, the International Development Agency.     Sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984 with Western government creditors of the Paris Club.     The sources said this pact was to have been followed by bilateral agreements, but fell through when Khartoum became unable to service debts in 1985.     A Bank of Sudan (Central Bank) spokesman said last month Khartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments with commercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.     Sudan has not received fresh loans since 1985 and the sources said it was only getting grants at present. Hopes that foreign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr budget deficit have been dashed, they added.     Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's government would shortly announce a four-year economic plan aimed at starting the country's recovery.     Details of the plan have not been made public. But the sources said it would be geared to generate agricultural exports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans that Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.

Prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters the broker, Joachim Schmidt, may be able to shed light on the affair in which VW says it might have been defrauded of up to 480 mln marks.     No charges have been laid in what may turn out to be West Germany's largest known currency fraud.     The incident has led to political calls for tighter controls on the free-wheeling money and currency markets.     Retemeyer gave no further details of the investigation. His office understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.     A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters that Schmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United States but had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were not known.     Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currency and money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banks and other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.     The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the state prosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came to light on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidence of personal enrichment by VW employees.     The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW had incurred losses in the ""three-figure millions"" because it had not protected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.     This was denied at the time by VW executive board chairman Carl Hahn.     Financial director Rolf Selowsky resigned last week after news of the currency fraud, an executive has been fired and several others are suspended.     A Frankfurt business lawyer, Egon Geis, said yesterday that on February 10 he had offered VW information about the currency fraud and offered to provide a written confession by someone involved.

1655," ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY     BY JULIE VORMAN, Reuters     HOUSTON, March 18 - The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts said.     Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990, some analysts said.     The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of the nation's largest gas reserves are located.     ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they're betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two.""     The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages.     The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, a barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.     In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.     Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won't be any better this year.""     He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil. Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost.""     Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.     George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.     ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said.     Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.     Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.     For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day.     But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery.     Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.     ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.     Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers, is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.     Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
1656," SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT     By Richard Jarvie, Reuters     RIO DE JANEIRO, March 18 - Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said.     Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.     The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA), told Reuters.     However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output.     ""Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,"" he said.     Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.     ""The prices are ridiculous,"" said Julian Mateo, vice president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League. ""At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.""     Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets.     An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. ""The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.""     In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the London-based International Sugar Organization.     Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover.     Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply.     Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added.     Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.     Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985.     The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels.     Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market.     Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000.     A national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru's production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.     At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre, ""grows like a weed"" throughout the region.     Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.     The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.     Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace.     Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles.     However, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.     Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.     ""The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,"" Brazil's Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting.     The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices.     GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact.     ""They have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,"" GEPLACEA's Latorre said.

1664," TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC <GY>     By Patti Domm, Reuters     New York, March 18 - The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company, analysts said.     Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses.     Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.     ""The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's cooperation,"" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group.     Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions.     ""I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"" said Baker of the offer.     Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction.     A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out.     If it received the ""short-form"" approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved.     General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.     Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell the stations.     GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station's license.     GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.     General Partners said it intends to keep the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment.     Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said.     The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said.     Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.     ""The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non-strategic assets of the company,"" Rose said.     Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.     General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about ""greenmail."" Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.     ""I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore,"" said Rose.     GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.      Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split.      The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.     Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect.     For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y. holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.      Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company's stock holders, the company said.     For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share.     In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding.

1707," CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS     CHICAGO, March 18 - Continental Illinois Corp's <CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months.     Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way.     ""I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt,"" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.     ""I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess,"" Swearingen said.     Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.     The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry.     Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.     Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.     In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.     The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government.     The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.     In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.     Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks.     Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.     He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.     The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank.     Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor.     The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash.

The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.     A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.     Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.     But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices.     Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.     He said ""If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.""     Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying ""in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.""     Otherwise, he said, ""the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.""     Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims.     Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.     ""Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,"" he said.     House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.     There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.      Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>.     Brooks also told a press conference that if management is successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.     ""I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur, and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,"" Brooks said.     Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.     Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government officials expressed opposition to the transaction.     Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.     He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors.     Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them, but he added, ""the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets.""     Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.     ""I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist,"" Brooks said.

1719," HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS     WASHINGTON, March 18 - The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.     Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.     Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.     Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added.     Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.     ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in the water,"" he said.     To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.     Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending.     Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.     Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said.     While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.     Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.     He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change.     Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas.     Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.     ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block,"" Glickman said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1720," CPC <CPC> SEES 1987 HIGHER EARNINGS PER SHARE     NEW YORK, March 18 - CPC International Inc said it expects 1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.     ""We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,"" the company said in its 1986 annual report.     In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share, on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142 mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in January.     A share buyback program started last year reduced the number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from 97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.     The food and grocery products company also said it was the subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit, filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New Jersey.     The suits are related to the company's purchase of its shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7 mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.     The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an artificially inflated price, violating securities laws, breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets.     CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of improper conduct and are defending the suits.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1721," U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH      By PETER ELSWORTH, Reuters      DALLAS, March 18 - The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today.      The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out.      ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent told Reuters.      ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again.""      The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel.      At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help.      Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985.      Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East.      ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp <XON>, the nation's largest oil company.      At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""      Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""      He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""      Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund"" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.      Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised.      In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world's total oil consumption by that date.      Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of <Pitts Oil Co>, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised.""      Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a ""shambles.""      Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,"" he said.      Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,"" adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by midyear.""

The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in 1992.     Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under review because of a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission that would have required the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing scrubbers.     Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers through the use of low-sulphur coal, and ""The addition of scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal air quality improvements.""     The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost power from Duke Power Co <DUK> for intermediate and peaking purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later development of a generating unit.     Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about 877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  ""The higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.""     A company spokesman said the company has already spent about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings it will make late this year or early next year.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.     The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.     The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.     New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987.     The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.     New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well.     The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.     President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.     However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.     He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy.     Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.     He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules.     Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units.     He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said.     In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee at a meeting later this month, FAO said: ""The long term trends point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.     ""Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the combined problem of low nutritional levels, rapidly rising populations, inadequate growth in both food production and incomes...,"" FAO said.     FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the committee, which meets between March 23 and April 1.     These included improving the international trading environment for agricutural commodities, reducing food surpluses in developed countries, conserving natural resources and speeding up the increase of food production in developing countries.

Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts.     Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs, or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.     De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results"" in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more specific.     He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990.     De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The rest came from acquisitions, he said.     Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation, a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.     He also said he is ""not very optimistic"" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.     De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp.     ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management,"" de Groote said.     Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S. subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.     De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.     De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.     The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.     He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely within the next few months.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1 billion dlrs.     The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.     The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.     In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.     Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue.     ""I don't remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area,"" FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters.     He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance.     Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue.      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said.     Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago.     Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said.     Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.     He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected.     But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said.  Reuter ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Exxon's new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery.     An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.     The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the spokesman added.     Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.

The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely to look favorably on requests for rate increases by these railroads made during the current year.     Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to rate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.     Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by the government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate if it finds it to be unreasonable.     In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry and shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of five commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.     ""For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns have fallen well short of their cost of capital, however defined,"" commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted with the majority.     The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the highest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and Ohio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3 pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and the Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.

SELA presented the document to a week-long conference of latin american financial and economic experts, meeting to lay the groundwork for this year's annual meeting of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad).     SELA called for new efforts to break ""the vicious circle of debt, stagnation and productive retrogression the region has been immersed in since the beginning of the decade.""

Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale.

Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8 pct of its stock.

1815," LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87     VIENNA, March 18 - Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said.     Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates.     The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.     Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: ""We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.""     Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.     Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.     Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg.     On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.     According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

1822," TRIPLE WITCHING ISSUE OVERHANGS FUTURES MEETING     By Nelson Graves, Reuters     BOCA RATON, Florida, March 18 - Leaders of the major U.S. commodity exchanges and their federal regulators begin a three-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry's growth but uncertain about their futures.     An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected to attend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures Industry Association, FIA.     The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of the U.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.     The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stems largely from a pervasive sense that the potential for major market disruption stalks the futures, options and equity industries.     This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as the financial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter's triple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threaten to rock markets.     Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and options and individual stock options expire simultaneously.     The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by price volatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments between stocks and their derivative instruments.     In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures contract, recently announced plans to move the contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterly expiration day from the afternoon.     The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends to implement stricter procedures requiring members to submit all market-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.     Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contract expirations, there is a sense more might have to be done to avert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.     Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats of fortified federal regulation and congressional action to strap market activity.     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Susan Phillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequate to cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects new surveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.     SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over price volatility associated with program trading, has resurrected a proposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulators control over the setting of futures margins.     Some contend that because futures margins are low relative to stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shift out of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hastening a downward price spiral.     Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressional player -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee responsible for overseeing the SEC.     Dingell has promised to look into program trading and explore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market disruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual trading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for their own account before placing customers' orders.     Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the perception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the practice. The CME board responded with a plan that would restrict, but not ban, the activity.     The meeting will also be attended by regulators from Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC proposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign futures and options on U.S. exchanges.     The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the grounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.     Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the exchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement strict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to revise federal limits on speculative positions and the definition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new instruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.

""This action on the part of the U.S. administration serves well our ultimate objective of a bilateral accord providing for a common resolution of this serious environment problem,"" Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in a statement.     Environment Minister Tom McMillan said the Reagan announcement was a major step toward elimination of acid rain and that Canada was pleased with the U.S. decision.     The Reagan announcement earlier today said the administration would ask Congress to approve 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.     Canada has been pressing the Reagan administration to live up to a commitment made last year for 5 billion dlrs in spending by the U.S. government and industry to cut toxic emissions that cause acid rain.     The acid rain issue has been the major irritant in Canada-U.S. relations for several years, with Ottawa accusing Washington of failing to act on the issue.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1843," AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY     By Larry Welsh, Reuters     TORONTO, March 18 - Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said.     State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>.     But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations.     ""It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,"" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented.     The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.     ""There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,"" he said.     Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.     The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said.     While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year.     The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company.     Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.     For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an ""excellent financial investment"" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said.     The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.     It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.     She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business.     Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation.     ""They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it,"" Szynkarsky said.     Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada.     ""The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,"" Hine said.     ""It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,"" he added.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis.     Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said.     By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.     The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said.     The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.     A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change, the press release said.

1866," SHEARSON SELLS NEW CDS FOR JAPANESE BANKS     NEW YORK, March 18 - Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said it has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to provide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the U.S. money markets.     The investment banker said its variable money market certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating rate CDs, with the rate based on the AA commercial paper composite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.     Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly institutional investors. The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.     The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were Sanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each with tranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.     The investment banking firm said another series of variable money market CDs is planned for April.     ""The variable money market CDs provide a low cost dependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks,"" said Robert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ""The instrument enables banks to diversify their funding base in a significant way.""     In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which is expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis points, Shearson said.     The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be subject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York Fed's commercial paper composite rate.     Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be determined by investor demand. It added that other Japanese banks may participate in future issues.     ""For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not only to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper investors at rates which are competitive with traditional floating rate CDs,"" said Michael Balaban, a vice president with Shearson's commercial paper unit.     He added, ""For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractive because they are domestically issued paper with competitive rates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks.""     Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money market funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1875," DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY     By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 18 - The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.     ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues.     Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.     Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed.     Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said.     Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year.""     Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.     John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy.""     Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time.     ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.     But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee.     Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies.     The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle.     Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.      At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests.     But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise.     Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action.""      But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.     In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

1889," ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL     By Manuel Villanueva     BUENOS AIRES, March 18 - Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February.     But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record.     The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.     The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province.     The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba.     Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.     Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.     With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting.     Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage.     The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     The current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.     Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume.     The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting activities.      The Fed said the application was similar to that of Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was approved last December.     Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90 billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New York and operates in the United States and abroad.     The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade association of the investment banking industry, had opposed Chase Manhattan's application for more powers.     Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.      In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was given authority to do.     The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.     The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of total market share.     The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to Chase Manhattan's regular banking activities because ""this kind of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional commercial loan.""     ""Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan,"" the Fed order said.     Among the benefits for the public will be increased competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1895," BAKER AND VOLCKER SAY DEBT STRATEGY WILL WORK     By Peter Torday, Reuters     WASHINGTON, March 18 - Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House leaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work, but acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the worse, Congressional sources and U.S. officials said.     Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks  yesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.     But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy gave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote economic growth and reform.     ""They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,"" one participant at the meeting said.     However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. ""And if things turned sour, they could turn very sour,"" a source quoted them as saying.     They were responding to questions from Wright, a Texas Democrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his concern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.     The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin American democracy and the danger that demagogues of either left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.     Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more confidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especially concerned about the political risks, and in particular the  fatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving the debt crisis would be a ""struggle"".     Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year, Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the administration on budget strategy.     His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that Congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more seriously now than in the past.     More worrisome for administration strategists is the possibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.     ""When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, they knew it wasn't just talk,"" one source at the meeting said.     The two economic policymakers listened patiently to descriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backed by gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.     The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country debt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking economic reforms.     The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries for their views under a bill approved by a House Banking subcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York House Democrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce Morrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.     The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders also attended the discussions.     U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the administration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday the concept of debt relief was misguided. ""If we write it all off and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither on the vine,"" the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital inflows that would follow debt relief.     Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new innovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.     Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on commercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major debtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.     ""They sat down together to discuss the implications for Latin America and feel each other out on the best way out,"" a Wright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect the dialogue to continue.     The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and an uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister, Dilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.     Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power over the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister Joao Sayad is further reason to worry.     Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial banks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has been presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, but did not come up yesterday.     Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt, ""is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American issue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger,"" said an aide, who asked not to be named.     There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by commercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors following substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.     At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultz is being advised the ""Baker plan is going through a rough patch"" while Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt more flexible approaches to guarantee their continued participation in the plan.

1913," FLEET <FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR     By Cal Mankowski, Reuters     NEW YORK, March 18 - Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.     Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.     The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. ""If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"" Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state.     He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.     If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said, an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions.     The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants.     Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.     Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as ""a partnership of two companies."" Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger.     Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.     That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion <RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.     Chemical New York Corp's <CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.     ""It's a merger of equals,"" said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs.     Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post.     Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today.     He noted that Fleet has a ""teriffic reputation"" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages.     The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.     Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined.     The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a ""lock-up"" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding.  Reuter ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

""We got a little volatility Wednesday,"" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. ""But for the moment we're still in a trading range.""     Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said.     ""It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. ""It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,"" he said.     Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy.     But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.     In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace.     ""The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,"" Quinn said.     Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said.     ""We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,"" compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.     In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures.     The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures.

The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security.     Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad.     The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered.     Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices.     Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April.     Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.     Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.     ""We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,"" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said.     The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices.     The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction.     At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders.

1926," CHILEAN COPPER WORKERS ELECT LEFT-WING LEADERS      SANTIAGO, March 18 - Chilean left-wing leaders were elected by the copper workers union for the first time since the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a 1973 coup.      Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement (MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.     Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the principal positions on the union's directorate.     The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.     The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents.     But the left-wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations.     Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.     Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.     The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO following a strike in 1983.     The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.      CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union leader when no longer employed by the company.  Reuter ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.

General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses.     It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.

General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products.     But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.     Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.

""We want to see the American farmer put in a position in which he can compete on a level playing field,"" Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers.     The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world agriculture.     Government policies that subsidize production and exports have created a ""crisis of overproduction,"" he said. Shultz particularly criticized European Community policies which he said encourage domestic production by providing high government supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with the help of huge subsidies.     The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. ""We have to agree to dismantle these systems together,"" he said.     The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead in agricultural reform, he said.

Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a ""memorandum of understanding"" on cargo preference.     Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money.     The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.     Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet.     ""As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet,"" Kay said.     Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.     In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.

1948," ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN PROPERTY MARKET     By Jonathan Thatcher, Reuters     HONG KONG, March 19 - Property looks set to continue to provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia and Australia this year.     A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economists around the region shows better returns are often more likely to come from buying and selling real estate than from rental income.     In central Tokyo, property analysts project commercial land prices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's 53.8 pct jump.     The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is Tokyo, where the top price paid for a central commercial property last year was 169,000 dlrs a square meter. A building in land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.     But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach of foreign investors.     Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spending record sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, but in particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment could double this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.     The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will rise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in construction will limit increases in some areas.     Property sales have become increasingly popular because in some sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several cities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.     ""We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see why the trend should not continue over the next few months,"" said Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong. But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk linked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.     In several other countries, analysts predicted at least some rise in property values, which in one or two cases, such as Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.     Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least seven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a result of government assistance, low mortgage rates and a generally bullish economic outlook.     Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the outlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, one Philippine developer said.     Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after five years in the doldrums, according to property developers in Taipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region's capitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.     One leading broker said the property market had become an attractive investment in Taiwan, noting property development yields of up to 15 pct.     Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Construction has helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s, though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on property ownership, as in many parts of Asia.     In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreign investment in property, combined with financial deregulation and a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in the market, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.     ""What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularly from Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new deals being done,"" said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate) of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.     Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct, and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after 15 pct rises in each of the past two years. REUTER... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments,"" he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan.

Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in Sumatra.     ""I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number,"" he said, according to the agency.     Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.

Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier.     Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending, they said.     Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2.     Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working.     However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments.     Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven.     But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.     The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.     Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.     A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's competitiveness, he said.     ""It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern,"" he added.

Dealers have said prices would continue to gain this year in view of good prospects for the economy and an expected partial opening of the market to direct foreign investment.     However, some analysts are concerned about potential risks such as South Korea's unstable domestic politics and the lack of market sophistication.

1984," NORTH KOREA TO RESURRECT GOLD MINE TO REPAY DEBT     TOKYO, March 19 - Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman for <Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.     Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.     ""We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in gold deposits,"" he said.     The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles north of Pyongyang, Li said.     Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields. ""Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment.""     The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.     Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The daily al-Riyadh reported Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz as saying: ""A thorough study by the Ministry on the submarines has been completed and it is probable King Fahd will announce the party with which the kingdom will deal to buy them.""     He gave no further details.     The London-based magazine Jane's Defence Weekly said last October the Saudi government had approached six European countries to supply between six and eight submarines at a cost of up to 2.9 billion dlrs.     It said Britain was expected to offer the Upholder submarine, made by Vickers Plc <VICK.L> and designed mainly for NATO. France, West Germany, Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands were also submitting proposals.

In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.     This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.     If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said.     Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats.     The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels.  REUTER ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1995," ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY     By Stephen Jukes, Reuters     RIYADH, March 19 - Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said.     The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector.     Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.     But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long.     Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.     Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.     King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy.     Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.     Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.     ""Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,"" a diplomat said.     In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.     But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term.     It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy.     Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to ""tough it out"" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves.     The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out.     Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.     ""It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,"" he said.     Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary.     The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.     Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.     The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.     Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.     Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit.     As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

1997," EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS     BRUSSELS, March 19 - The rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, EC Commission officials said.     The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention.     The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed, the officials said.     The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates.     They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.     The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would drive down market prices further.     They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.     ""We think they realise they have gone too far,"" one official said.
